[MUSIC]

2
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:53.820
More great music.

3
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.870
This time by Chopin.

4
00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.960
What do I personally experience here?

5
00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.180
What do I feel?

6
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.480
At the beginning a sense of soaring,
perhaps gliding above the cares of life.

7
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.650
Enjoying something very pleasurable.

8
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.590
And then, the bottom falls out.

9
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.960
Something dark and somber.

10
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.632
Chopin was actually thinking
of this as a funeral march.

11
00:01:17.632 --> 00:01:27.632
[MUSIC]

12
00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:39.815
I like to think of music or any art
as a collateral experience to life,

13
00:01:39.815 --> 00:01:45.180
Yo-Yo Ma, the great cellist recently said,
art is life.

14
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.440
Well, I'd life to refine that just a bit,

15
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.870
by suggesting that art is something
close to life but not quite life.

16
00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.780
It's another life,
the life of the imagination.

17
00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.880
This second life, through art, enhances
our primary, our everyday existence.

18
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.960
It makes our journey through life
a richer, more enjoyable one.

19
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.200
Well, these are semi high
sounding ideas about art and

20
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.130
about life, but let's get to specifics.

21
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.640
What about music?

22
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.299
What is music?

23
00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.117
Well my very pedestrian
definition of music would be,

24
00:02:23.117 --> 00:02:28.264
the rational organization of sounds and
silences passing through time.

25
00:02:28.264 --> 00:02:33.070
But the 19th century writer
Victor Hugo expressed it better.

26
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.240
Music is what feelings sound like.

27
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.320
Music is what feelings sound like.

28
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.560
In other words, it's a language.

29
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.970
It's a mode of expression,
of feelings and sensations.

30
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.520
What exactly does music do for us?

31
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.670
Well, music can relax us
after a difficult day.

32
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.060
Take away stress.

33
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.650
Music can excite us.

34
00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.060
When you exercise, jog or
run do you listen to music?

35
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.400
Many people do.

36
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.980
Why?

37
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.000
Well, the music helps
us jump start the body.

38
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.060
We'll explore that soon.

39
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.840
Music can show us a vision
of a better world,

40
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.650
where everything is harmony and balance.

41
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.160
I feel that particularly when
listening to the music of Mozart.

42
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.310
Music can help keep us up to date.

43
00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.220
Many youngsters listen to pop
music to learn what's going on,

44
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.990
what's current in popular culture.

45
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.570
Music can bring us all together.

46
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.500
We can bond,
show that we belong to a group,

47
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.660
reaffirm common values,
new values, older values.

48
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.550
We do this when we go to a rock
concert at Yankee Stadium,

49
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.010
just as when we go to hear Mozart or
Wagner at the Metropolitan Opera.

50
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.700
We are reaffirming values,
as we bond with the music.

51
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.120
Let's see how this works.

52
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.650
Here's the beginning of
a cantata by JS Bach.

53
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.380
Bach composed it for a German
church in the 18th century, the St.

54
00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.040
Thomas Church, Leipzig,
which we'll see on the screen now.

55
00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.046
As the listeners,
the congregation, gathers,

56
00:04:05.046 --> 00:04:07.679
the chorus sings a hymn, the tune.

57
00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:11.642
In Bach's day, the listeners and
chorus would have sung together,

58
00:04:11.642 --> 00:04:14.593
sharing a common belief,
bonding with the music.

59
00:04:14.593 --> 00:04:24.593
>> [MUSIC]

60
00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:43.595
>> Now,
another kind of bonding through the music.

61
00:04:43.595 --> 00:04:48.836
A concert of Swedish House Mafia in
San Francisco, where the congregation,

62
00:04:48.836 --> 00:04:53.202
here the audience, sings the melody,
Don't You Worry Child.

63
00:04:53.202 --> 00:05:03.202
>> [MUSIC]

64
00:05:13.881 --> 00:05:17.818
>> As with the Bach example,
those singing in this video are saying,

65
00:05:17.818 --> 00:05:20.450
I'm part of this community, I belong.

66
00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.040
We have validity.

67
00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.639
But in these contexts, it's the music
that brings us together and that's good.

68
00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:30.798
It's very difficult to hate
someone who passionately loves

69
00:05:30.798 --> 00:05:32.681
the same music that you do.
