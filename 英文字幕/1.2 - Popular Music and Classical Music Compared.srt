[MUSIC]

2
00:00:11.327 --> 00:00:15.146
>> Most of the world listen to what
is generally called popular music,

3
00:00:15.146 --> 00:00:19.100
music of the people, and
music that almost everybody likes.

4
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.390
Downloads of pop music outnumber those
of classical music about 30 to one.

5
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.680
But most of this course will be concerned
with listening to classical music.

6
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.810
What does that mean, classical music?

7
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.780
The term applies to any music, indeed,
any object, that's been around for

8
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.160
a long time, that's been passed on
from one generation to the next.

9
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.250
Likely there's a vocabulary of terms
to discuss that music or that artifact.

10
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.900
And finally, that music has certain
universally appreciated qualities.

11
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.630
Balance, proportion, that sort of thing.

12
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.400
We have classics in automobiles,
timepieces, paintings,

13
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.410
architecture, and, of course, music.

14
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.270
These classical objects are associated
today with so-called high end art.

15
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.300
For Western art music, the term classical
didn't appear until rather late,

16
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.720
the 19th century, again, in Germany, when
audiences began to demand that concert

17
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.910
programmers go back and replay older
music, the music of the late 18th century.

18
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.260
Mozart, Hayden and Beethoven.

19
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.640
Up to that point, when you went to
a concert you'd always hear new music.

20
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.780
Why would anyone want to go and
hear old music?

21
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.685
But now, in the 19th century,
concert goers start to look backward to

22
00:01:35.685 --> 00:01:40.090
the now-called classics of Mozart and
Hayden and Beethoven.

23
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.490
How does popular music
differ from Classical music?

24
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.090
Well, here are five important ways,
said quickly.

25
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.300
Popular music often uses electric
instruments, electric guitars and

26
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.340
electric keyboards.

27
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.719
This is an electric instrument

28
00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:01.351
[MUSIC]

29
00:02:01.351 --> 00:02:05.730
made to sound like a keyed
stringed instrument.

30
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.670
But it is an electric instrument.

31
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.630
Classical music, on the other hand,
uses acoustic instruments,

32
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.270
instruments generating sound
from natural materials.

33
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.510
Pop music,
pop music also has a text, lyrics.

34
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.690
They tell you what the music is about.

35
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.730
Classical music, on the other hand,
is usually purely instrumental.

36
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:28.870
Usually, purely instrumental.

37
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.760
The music itself has to
tell you what it is about.

38
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.280
It has to sound out it's meaning.

39
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.730
Third, pop music tends
to have a strong beat.

40
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.650
In Classical music
the beat is more subdued.

41
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.220
Let's demonstrate now these first three
points by comparing a pop piece by

42
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.739
John Bon Jovi to a classical one by
Peter Tchaikovsky, a piano concerto.

43
00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.894
Let's start with the Bon Jovi.

44
00:02:54.894 --> 00:03:04.894
[MUSIC]

45
00:03:06.154 --> 00:03:09.834
>> Is there anybody out there looking for
a party?

46
00:03:09.834 --> 00:03:13.559
[MUSIC]

47
00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:15.209
Shake your money maker, baby.

48
00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.350
Smoke it if you got it.

49
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.560
>> So, we hear a lot of electronica here.

50
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.280
A very strong beat,
especially when the drum enters and

51
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.180
the text we've got it going on.

52
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.840
Well, we've got it going
on in classical music, too.

53
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.321
Here's a piece, indeed, a piano concerto

54
00:03:39.321 --> 00:03:45.252
by the classical composer
Peter Tchaikovsky.

55
00:03:45.252 --> 00:03:55.252
[MUSIC]

56
00:04:21.125 --> 00:04:23.783
Well, that piece has a strong melody.

57
00:04:23.783 --> 00:04:30.122
And, actually, also a rather clear beat,
a clearer beat than most Classical music.

58
00:04:30.122 --> 00:04:39.723
[MUSIC]

59
00:04:39.723 --> 00:04:40.906
And so on.

60
00:04:40.906 --> 00:04:42.790
Maybe that's why we like it so much.

61
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.140
Because it does have
a pretty clear beat there.

62
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.850
Finally, two last points.

63
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.540
Popular music tends to be short and
sometimes repetitious.

64
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.870
The melody, the tune,
gets sung again and again.

65
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.180
Classical pieces are often longer.

66
00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.690
They can be 20, 30 minutes, even more,
and they unfold more continually.

67
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:04.820
And fifth, and

68
00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:10.180
finally, popular music is usually
performed without musical notation.

69
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.610
When you see Madonna at Yankee stadium
she's not singing from sheet music.

70
00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:15.770
That'd be ridiculous.

71
00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.950
Same thing with Kanye West, or
whoever might be your favorite pop artist.

72
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.920
There is no prescriptive written
document for pop performances, and many

73
00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.560
different artists can interpret a song in
a particular way, do a cover of that song.

74
00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.840
Classical music, on the other hand, tends
to be performed from a written score.

75
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.000
It's old, and it has to be done more or
less the same way each time.

76
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.810
And because there is a prescriptive
document stipulating precisely how it

77
00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:49.270
should go, Classical music
tends to stay more on message.

78
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:54.080
Classical performances really don't
differ all that much from one performance

79
00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.630
to the next.

80
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.740
Here on the screen,
you see an orchestral score of the famous

81
00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.850
Rite of Spring of Igor Stravinsky,
now more than 100 years old.

82
00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.310
Look at all those parts sounding together.

83
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.560
Indeed, it's complicated.

84
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.362
So you have to write out this musical
code so that everything fits together, so

85
00:06:17.362 --> 00:06:21.463
that the performers play all
together when they're supposed to.
