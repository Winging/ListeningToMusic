[MUSIC]

2
00:00:08.891 --> 00:00:10.765
All right, let's have some fun.

3
00:00:10.765 --> 00:00:12.600
But fun with a point.

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.340
As we said at the introduction to our
course, music works in mysterious ways.

5
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.090
Here's a riddle for you I've made up.

6
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:20.200
You can't see it.

7
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.170
You can't touch it or feel it.

8
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.770
You can't hold it in your hand.

9
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.000
But it can touch you, it can grab you.

10
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.210
It can move you to cry or
move you to dance with joy.

11
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.100
What is it?

12
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.510
Well, of course, music.

13
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:34.670
It's the poetry of the air.

14
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.800
Indeed, music can move us.

15
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.230
Music can manipulate us.

16
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.750
Advertisers and
marketing people know this.

17
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.010
They use music to persuade
us to buy something.

18
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.950
Here's a watch, a high-end watch.

19
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.360
It's a classic.

20
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.910
Now let's assume it's your
job to market this watch,

21
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.840
what kind of music are you going to
put with it to enhance it's appeal?

22
00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.732
This kind?

23
00:00:58.732 --> 00:01:02.552
[MUSIC]

24
00:01:02.552 --> 00:01:04.224
Music of Mozart.

25
00:01:04.224 --> 00:01:14.224
[MUSIC]

26
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.861
Or would you choose this kind.

27
00:01:19.861 --> 00:01:29.861
[MUSIC]

28
00:01:33.142 --> 00:01:35.661
I suspect it would be more effective.

29
00:01:35.661 --> 00:01:39.630
You'd make more sales, if you choose
the Mozart rather than the Eminem.

30
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.100
Here, classical music reinforces
the message you want to create.

31
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.304
That this watch is a classic.

32
00:01:47.304 --> 00:01:52.620
Classic object, timeless music.

33
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.060
Here's another interesting
thing about music.

34
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.850
Did you ever notice this?

35
00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.080
Certain musics were better
at different times.

36
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.580
Music of the Baroque period, Bach and
Handel, they generally get played

37
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.170
in the morning, for reasons that
we'll go into later in our course.

38
00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.920
There's a longstanding radio show on
PBS called Sunday Morning Baroque,

39
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.630
not late Friday night Baroque.

40
00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.210
To see how music and mood and
motivation might work together,

41
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.910
let's suppose that you wish to seduce
the object of your amatory desire.

42
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.870
Your boyfriend, girlfriend, wife,
husband, partner, whatever.

43
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.100
You shop for the food and cook the meal.

44
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.810
Set the table.

45
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.925
Chosen the stemware, flowers, and

46
00:02:35.925 --> 00:02:41.561
now it comes time to select the music
to make this all just perfect.

47
00:02:41.561 --> 00:02:46.411
What kind of music would you
select to make the object of your

48
00:02:46.411 --> 00:02:48.551
desire melt in your arms?

49
00:02:48.551 --> 00:02:49.398
This?

50
00:02:49.398 --> 00:02:59.398
[MUSIC]

51
00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:18.676
Or would you choose this?

52
00:03:18.676 --> 00:03:22.753
[MUSIC]

53
00:03:22.753 --> 00:03:24.178
Now we're talking.

54
00:03:24.178 --> 00:03:34.178
[MUSIC]

55
00:03:38.016 --> 00:03:41.810
The first one,
the Bach just doesn't do the job.

56
00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.270
I think we'd all agree to that.

57
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.610
The questions is, why not?

58
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.277
What is it about the Puccini that
makes us all want to melt or succumb?

59
00:03:49.277 --> 00:03:54.036
And about the Bach that makes
our mind focus intensely,

60
00:03:54.036 --> 00:03:56.881
perhaps think rather than meld?

61
00:03:56.881 --> 00:04:06.881
[MUSIC]

62
00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:12.660
The Bach's a great piece,
but it forces us to think.

63
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.780
And maybe analytical thinking is not
what is required, or wanted, here.

64
00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.340
Is it possible that we are engaging
different sections of the brain

65
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.450
when we hear these two different pieces?

66
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.620
Bach is great music, but
is a different kind of music, and

67
00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.740
it just doesn't work in this nocturnal,
amatory environment here.

68
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:33.940
Why not?

69
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.292
You tell me, what's the difference
in sound between these two pieces?
