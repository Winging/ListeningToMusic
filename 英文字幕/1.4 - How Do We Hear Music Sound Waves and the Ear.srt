00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.696
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:09.696 --> 00:00:13.151
As we said, music is the rational
organization of sounds and

3
00:00:13.151 --> 00:00:15.510
silences passing through time.

4
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.370
That's my definition,
you can have your own, and

5
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.510
it's a general one, maybe a bit wordy.

6
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.220
A more down to Earth definition
would say that music,

7
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.890
indeed any sound,
is simply a disturbance of the atmosphere.

8
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.990
But music is a regularly organized
disturbance of the atmosphere resulting in

9
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.290
sound waves coming in regular patterns.

10
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.810
Sound waves are simply
differing air pressures.

11
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.710
Air being compressed,
or air being expanded.

12
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.720
And the pattern is regularly repeated.

13
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.370
We have large sound waves,
and smaller sound waves.

14
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.570
Large ones generate low pitches.

15
00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.780
Small ones generate high pitches.

16
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:06.425
A very long string creates an equally
long sound and a low sound.

17
00:01:06.425 --> 00:01:10.376
[SOUND].

18
00:01:10.376 --> 00:01:16.350
Now, this string on the piano here,
is vibrating at about 30 times per second.

19
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.446
The highest note on the piano,
[SOUND] way up here,

20
00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:24.338
the highest note on the piano is
vibrating about 4,000 times per second.

21
00:01:24.338 --> 00:01:29.660
We don't hear all those 4,000 vibrations,
but they can be measured in a laboratory.

22
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.260
Let's take a look at a diagram.

23
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.280
It shows a pitch on top and
multiples of it underneath.

24
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.070
Did you see four pitches here on this
particular screen from top to bottom?

25
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.870
The top one is shaking, vibrating,
about 110 times per second.

26
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.585
If we double the vibration to 220
times per second we get this sound.

27
00:01:55.585 --> 00:02:01.614
[SOUND] If we double it again to
440 per second, we get this sound.

28
00:02:01.614 --> 00:02:06.475
[SOUND] And indeed this is the pitch
that the oboe plays at the beginning of

29
00:02:06.475 --> 00:02:11.997
orchestral concerts to give the pitch for
the rest of the instruments to tune to.

30
00:02:11.997 --> 00:02:15.763
Then, as you see on the bottom,
if we double this yet

31
00:02:15.763 --> 00:02:18.940
again we get 880 vibrations per second.

32
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.151
That low sound wave, down here,
[SOUND] that actually,

33
00:02:25.151 --> 00:02:30.121
physically a little less than 12
feet long as it goes unseen, but

34
00:02:30.121 --> 00:02:32.546
heard through the atmosphere.

35
00:02:32.546 --> 00:02:36.140
220, well that's a little
less than 6 feet.

36
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.650
A 440 somewhat less than 3 feet.

37
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.790
Obviously to be heard,
sound must reach the ear.

38
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.730
Once there,
sound waves enter the inner ear.

39
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.010
And ultimately are changed into
electro chemical impulses.

40
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.680
The heavy lifting here occurs in a small
organ called the basilar membrane.

41
00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:05.125
Here, filaments, called cilia
are activated by particular sound waves.

42
00:03:05.125 --> 00:03:09.870
In other words,
the basilar membrane is tonotopic.

43
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.180
Each of the many cilia responds to
only one frequency, high or low.

44
00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.650
When stimulated by a particular
sound wave, the cilia send a signal.

45
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.630
Hey brain, heads up,
the frequency A-440 is coming in.

46
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.280
The sound goes to the brain,
through first the primary

47
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.790
auditory nerve, and then, to the left and
right side of the cortex.

48
00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.230
So here on the screen, you see the left
side of the brain, the left cortex.

49
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.020
In the gray area, we have the temporal
lobe, and within the temporal lobe,

50
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:52.900
the primary auditory cortex where much
of the processing of sound occurs.

51
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.646
It too is tonotopic.

52
00:03:54.646 --> 00:03:59.680
The neurons there respond only
to particular frequencies.

53
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.540
All of this is something of a
simplification, but it gives you a general

54
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:09.190
sense of what is happening as musical
sounds enter our ear and our brain.

55
00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.360
And it's complex,

56
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.710
because many parts of the brain
are engaged when we listen to music.

57
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:20.770
The frontal lobe, as you see out there
to the left in the green color, and

58
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:22.550
the prefrontal lobe.

59
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.850
They might be involved in issues that,
where am I in this piece?

60
00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.430
You gotta use thinking.

61
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.720
That's what that's for.

62
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.420
The parietal lobe.

63
00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:31.530
Well, that involves movement.

64
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:32.496
If I'm playing my

65
00:04:32.496 --> 00:04:33.918
[MUSIC]

66
00:04:33.918 --> 00:04:38.896
I have to coordinate my auditory
processes with physical processes here

67
00:04:38.896 --> 00:04:40.948
involving the motor cortex.

68
00:04:42.411 --> 00:04:43.350
Indition?

69
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.090
Well, we might have to remember.

70
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.630
We might have to think about,
well have I heard this before?

71
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.980
And that might involve the hippocampus.

72
00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.080
And there is a vast and
certainly not fully understood

73
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.120
interconnected network of
associative linkage in the brain,

74
00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.570
with the information being sent
around at about 250 miles per hour.

75
00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.480
So a lot is happening when we listen
to music, and it's happening very fast.

76
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.250
And that says nothing about
how we feel about the music.

77
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.800
Which to some measure,
is the responsibility

78
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.720
of another part of the brain,
the limbic system, including the amygdala.

79
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.420
Whew, it is complicated.

80
00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.820
Maybe the brain is as
mysterious as music itself.

81
00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.320
And while we're on
the subject of music and

82
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.870
the brain, let's think about how it is
that music excites us or relaxes us.

83
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.320
Gets us pumped up to lift weights,
or run, or calms us down at night.

84
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.110
In our brain,
information about sound is transformed,

85
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.860
as we have said,
into electrochemical impulses.

86
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.570
Into chemical neurotransmitters
such as dopamine and glutamates.

87
00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:00.050
These move from one cell to the next,
exciting or inhibiting

88
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.330
the neighboring cells causing us in one
way or another to get excited or to relax.

89
00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:09.330
But likely you know all this from
your biology and chemistry courses.

90
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:16.520
Neuroscientists have discovered that
music has the same effect as quote, and

91
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.000
I'm not kidding, quote,
other euphoria-inducing stimuli,

92
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.350
such as food, sex, and
drugs of abuse, end quote.

93
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.040
So that's interesting.

94
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.560
Music is like candy for the mind.

95
00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.675
So don't take drugs, listen to music.

96
00:06:31.675 --> 00:06:32.590
It's a lot better for you.
