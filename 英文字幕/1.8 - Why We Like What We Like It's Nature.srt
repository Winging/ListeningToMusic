00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:16.693 --> 00:00:18.800
Turning now to nature.

3
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.940
There are in fact,

4
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.790
principals about the physics of music
that apply to all musical cultures.

5
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.839
Universal principals about the physics and
the acoustics of sound.

6
00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:32.690
Let's take a look at just one of them,
the overtone series.

7
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.250
The overtone series does indeed involve,
as the Beach Boys say here,

8
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.130
good vibrations.

9
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.100
When any string on an instrument or
column of air in a tube

10
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.610
created by a wind instrument, produces a
sound, actually it's producing many sounds

11
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.010
through something of an auditory trick or
illusion.

12
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.960
We hear only the lowest sound in
part because it's the loudest.

13
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.275
But there are many other strings sounding,
as when I play this pitch.

14
00:01:05.275 --> 00:01:13.671
[SOUND] Now we can represent this sound
by a diagram as you see on the screen.

15
00:01:13.671 --> 00:01:18.687
Here we have one string sounding,
that's the black string.

16
00:01:18.687 --> 00:01:21.300
But it's also being divided.

17
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.060
Halves of that string are sounding,
thirds of that string are sounding,

18
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.320
quarters, fifths, and so on.

19
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.930
And this applies to all
musical instruments.

20
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.290
Now, let's look at these
vibrations in a different way,

21
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.640
now with the lengths of
string standing vertically.

22
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.260
The first, and lowest, the one to
the left, we call the fundamental.

23
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.670
And all the others the overtones.

24
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.483
These overtones are small string sections
vibrating softly in the background.

25
00:01:51.483 --> 00:01:54.725
So, we have the fundamental and
the overtones,

26
00:01:54.725 --> 00:01:59.481
notice that the first overtone is
only half as long as the fundamental.

27
00:01:59.481 --> 00:02:01.417
It reflects a two to one ratio,

28
00:02:01.417 --> 00:02:06.190
which in music always produces
the sound that we call an octave.

29
00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.820
A distance of eight letter
names on the scale.

30
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.854
We'll get into all that
in our third session.

31
00:02:11.854 --> 00:02:16.775
Next comes a rate relationship,
a ratio of three to two.

32
00:02:16.775 --> 00:02:20.345
Three units of strings
sounding against two units.

33
00:02:20.345 --> 00:02:23.375
That produces what we call
the interval of a fifth.

34
00:02:23.375 --> 00:02:24.140
So here's the octave.

35
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.705
[SOUND] Here's the interval [INAUDIBLE].

36
00:02:26.705 --> 00:02:30.348
[SOUND] Then we come to four units
of string sounding against three,

37
00:02:30.348 --> 00:02:32.638
which produces the interval of a fourth.

38
00:02:32.638 --> 00:02:36.620
[SOUND] Spans four letter names.

39
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.078
Then five to four which gives us
interval of the third and so on.

40
00:02:41.078 --> 00:02:45.702
[SOUND] Now we can take,
as you see on the screen here,

41
00:02:45.702 --> 00:02:51.920
the fundamental and all these overtones
and apply them to a keyboard.

42
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.474
We hear the fundamental
note way down here.

43
00:02:54.474 --> 00:03:00.062
[SOUND] But we also hear the first
overtone, second overtone,

44
00:03:00.062 --> 00:03:04.795
third overtone, second,
and on up the scale we go.

45
00:03:04.795 --> 00:03:05.678
These others,

46
00:03:05.678 --> 00:03:08.103
[MUSIC]

47
00:03:08.103 --> 00:03:14.650
We hear this and
these others are sounding very quiet.

48
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.010
These are the overtones at work.

49
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.220
The octave the fifth,
the fourth, and so on.

50
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.040
These are the primary units
of music around the world.

51
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.701
In Indonesian gamelan music, Chinese
music, every music, classical or pop.

52
00:03:29.701 --> 00:03:35.437
We all have the same overtones and
therefore the basic notion of consonances.

53
00:03:35.437 --> 00:03:39.593
We all have the same basic
notion of consonance.

54
00:03:39.593 --> 00:03:43.435
Because when I play these
fundamental notes, this fundamental.

55
00:03:43.435 --> 00:03:50.192
[MUSIC]

56
00:03:50.192 --> 00:03:53.720
We get this very [SOUND] consonant sound.

57
00:03:58.399 --> 00:04:03.472
Knowing this was important
to Richard Strauss.

58
00:04:03.472 --> 00:04:05.214
He knew it and he used it.

59
00:04:05.214 --> 00:04:06.339
He used the fundamental,

60
00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:10.914
[MUSIC]

61
00:04:10.914 --> 00:04:14.989
In a famous piece called,
Also sprach Zarathustra.

62
00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.937
It's a big piece for
a western symphony orchestra.

63
00:04:17.937 --> 00:04:22.418
The name is German and it sounds
very impressive, very intimidating.

64
00:04:22.418 --> 00:04:25.695
But you've heard this piece
a thousand times on film and

65
00:04:25.695 --> 00:04:27.516
in countless TV commercials.

66
00:04:27.516 --> 00:04:33.413
In it, Strauss builds up the beginning of
the piece by using the primary overtones

67
00:04:33.413 --> 00:04:39.135
[MUSIC]

68
00:04:39.135 --> 00:04:41.968
What's this piece about this,
Also sprach Zarathustra.

69
00:04:41.968 --> 00:04:45.868
Well, said very simply,
it's about the dawn of a superman,

70
00:04:45.868 --> 00:04:51.810
a superhero who is equated with the rising
of the sun and the advent of the new age.

71
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.723
How does composer Strauss depict,
through music, the rising of the sun and

72
00:04:56.723 --> 00:04:57.808
the super hero?

73
00:04:57.808 --> 00:05:01.546
Well, let's give a listen.

74
00:05:01.546 --> 00:05:11.546
[MUSIC]

75
00:05:26.053 --> 00:05:31.370
Well, we start with low rumblings down
underneath to suggest primordial slime.

76
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:32.983
Then the sound of the trumpet.

77
00:05:32.983 --> 00:05:37.078
Since time immemorial, the trumpet has
been associated with the military,

78
00:05:37.078 --> 00:05:39.983
the army, with royalty,
with power, with the hero.

79
00:05:39.983 --> 00:05:43.152
And this powerful sound is moving upwards.

80
00:05:43.152 --> 00:05:44.860
It reaches a midway point and

81
00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.213
then seems to fall back as if the super
hero is not quite equal to the task.

82
00:05:49.213 --> 00:05:53.531
[MUSIC]

83
00:05:53.531 --> 00:05:56.933
Then he tries again, but
is now able to reach,

84
00:05:56.933 --> 00:05:59.777
[MUSIC]

85
00:05:59.777 --> 00:06:03.712
And hold onto the sought after goal.

86
00:06:03.712 --> 00:06:13.712
[MUSIC]

87
00:06:28.753 --> 00:06:32.207
Eventually we move onto the end,
to the conclusion of

88
00:06:32.207 --> 00:06:36.600
this opening section where we end
with this, a chord progression.

89
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.818
Remember, a syntax tells
us we've got to go home.

90
00:06:38.818 --> 00:06:45.296
[MUSIC]

91
00:06:45.296 --> 00:06:49.681
And that final chord there
is a very consonant chord,

92
00:06:49.681 --> 00:06:53.971
consisting of pitches made
up the fundamental, and

93
00:06:53.971 --> 00:06:58.959
the first four overtones
sounding loudly now all together.

94
00:06:58.959 --> 00:07:04.392
But it sounds a lot better when played
by a full western symphony orchestra.

95
00:07:04.392 --> 00:07:14.392
[MUSIC]

96
00:07:51.373 --> 00:07:54.485
Now that's the power of classical music.

97
00:08:08.044 --> 00:08:12.779
[MUSIC]
