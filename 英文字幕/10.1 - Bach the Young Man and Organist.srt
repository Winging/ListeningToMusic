[MUSIC]

2
00:00:20.901 --> 00:00:22.314
So, there's the great man.

3
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.490
The only authentic likeness of J.S. Bach.

4
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.640
He's holding a canon, a round,
because canons are difficult to create.

5
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:39.260
This shows not only that Bach was
a musician, but a learned musician.

6
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.540
Bach, the learned musician,
that's the title of a book

7
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.710
by my colleague at Harvard,
the great Bach scholar Kristof Wolf.

8
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.950
Our sessions on Bach and
Handel, of course,

9
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.380
will take us to the music of the late
Baroque in it's mature style.

10
00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.479
These are long, complex pieces, done with
great ingenuity and great integrity.

11
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.850
Bach and Handel were both Germans and they
were both born in the same year, 1685.

12
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.050
And they were born even near one another,
in Germany as we'll see.

13
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.900
But let's start with the Bachs.

14
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.690
The many faces of the Bachs.

15
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.270
Indeed, they were a dynasty of musicians.

16
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.510
From the 16th through the 19th Century.

17
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.080
Ten generations of Bachs, here we see.

18
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.230
The most famous J.S.

19
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.840
Bach, top of, upper left hand corner
there, Johann Sebastian Bach.

20
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.940
And then his son, Carl Philip Emmanuel
Bach, and then another son of J.S.

21
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.610
Bach, Johann Christian Bach, and then
another one, Wilhelm Friedman Bach, and

22
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.380
then over to the far right, I have no
idea but we can be sure, it's a Bach.

23
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.580
If we look down at the bottom there,
bottom left,

24
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.970
we see a portrait of Bach's father,
Ambrosius Bach.

25
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.730
Bach's father was a town musician,
who often played in the town wind band,

26
00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.250
he played an instrument called the shawm,
that we've talked about before, and

27
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.010
here's what a town band looked like, as we
can tell by glancing at this early 17th

28
00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:15.330
century Dutch painting there on
the lower right hand side of this slide.

29
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.620
This first map shows where
Bach was born in 1685.

30
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.470
And rather soon, both his parents died.

31
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.320
Actually they were both
dead by the time he was 11.

32
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.220
And so
he became a ward of his older brother.

33
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.740
And then, he went off, J.S Bach
went off to prep school in effect.

34
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.350
Where he was a boy soprano in
the choir school at LÃ¼neburg,

35
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.740
way up in northern Germany.

36
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.040
Singing paid his way through school.

37
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.040
Thereafter, when his voice broke,
at the age of 18.

38
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:58.520
He took a job at the church of Arnstadt,
a town then of about 3000 as an organist.

39
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.010
Here we see the pipes of
the original organ of Bach's day,

40
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.560
the framework and the pipes.

41
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.890
And here we see the console,

42
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:14.280
in a sense the central processing unitwith
keyboards of Bach's original organ.

43
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.910
This is his original instrument,
two manuals, two keyboards for

44
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.670
hands, and a keyboard for
the pedal, pedal keyboard.

45
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.710
And we see the stops,

46
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.900
those round knobs around
the circumference of the in, instrument.

47
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.696
They allow the organist to
sound various groups of pipe.

48
00:03:35.696 --> 00:03:41.060
Sound one group which might
have the sound of a trumpet or

49
00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.480
sound another group whichmight have
the sound of an oboe or even a shawm.

50
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:51.230
And if you pull them out all
together you get a very big sound.

51
00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.070
Pulling out all of the stops.

52
00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.060
So again, this processing core went
inside the original framework,

53
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.610
the original casement of Bach's organ,
and here we see it.

54
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.880
When he was a young man at Arnstadt,
Bach asked for a leave of absence.

55
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.750
He wanted to visit the city of Lubeck.

56
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:20.520
So off he goes, he walks the 225 miles one
way, didn't have any money, couldn't fly,

57
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:27.060
walked 225 miles up there to hear and
meet Dieterich Buxtehude in Lubeck.

58
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.110
And here's the church in
which Buxtehude worked,

59
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.470
Bach went up spent a couple of
weeks there and then returned.

60
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.720
Oddly enough Handel,
Handel made the same sort of trip.

61
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.310
Handel was in Hamburg and he went to Lu,
Lubeck about this same time.

62
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.200
So Bach walks to Lubeck and
then walks back.

63
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.400
And as you can see from this map here.

64
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:54.470
He returns somewhat late, tardy or
late into Orange dot and then moved on.

65
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.650
And eventually is settled in Weimar,

66
00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.260
a slightly larger town
in the court's center.

67
00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.880
The center of the Duchy of Weimar.

68
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:10.198
So here Bach in Weimar was an organist
in the duke's orchestra and

69
00:05:10.198 --> 00:05:17.430
a string player,
violinist into Duke's orchestra as well.

70
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:23.850
And some of Bach's most famous early
organ works were composed here.

71
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.760
The somewhat frightening sounds of
the Toccata and Fugue in D minor.

72
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.930
Now, a toccata is a type
of keyboard music.

73
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.970
Literally, it means something touched.

74
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.839
So, when one touches an instrument.

75
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:41.030
But as a musical Toccata
is usually a free flowing

76
00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.260
unpredictable composition of
some what improvisatory style.

77
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.127
So here's the music of
the Toccata in D minor.

78
00:05:50.127 --> 00:06:00.127
[MUSIC]

79
00:06:06.264 --> 00:06:11.500
You can see the organist is ornamenting
auction original scores no doubt.

80
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.424
[MUSIC]

81
00:06:15.424 --> 00:06:16.887
And his big diminish chord.

82
00:06:16.887 --> 00:06:19.661
[MUSIC]

83
00:06:19.661 --> 00:06:22.520
Ornamental resolution to a major chord.

84
00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:28.080
Well, this is a quick look at the life and
music of young Bach.

85
00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.133
The beginning of the music
of his mature period, for

86
00:06:33.133 --> 00:06:36.679
mature Bach,
we'll move on to the city of Kothen.
