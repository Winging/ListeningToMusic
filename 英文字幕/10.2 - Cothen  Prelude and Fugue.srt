00:00:00.106 --> 00:00:09.316
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:09.316 --> 00:00:12.960
In the year 1770,
Bach was on the move yet again.

3
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.280
At stake here was the position of
Kapellmeister, director of music.

4
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.480
A prestigious job in 18th
century German society.

5
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.980
His position was open at Cöthen, so
Bach went over to Cöthen to apply for

6
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.560
the position of Kapellmeister
of the prince of Cöthen.

7
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.640
And Bach was awarded the position.

8
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.100
He got the job.

9
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.950
End of story.

10
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.480
But not exactly.

11
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.420
It turns out that in the 18th century, if
an employee was taken into the service of

12
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.330
a member of the nobility or a high ranking
clergyman he belonged to that lord.

13
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.270
He just couldn't quit.

14
00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.021
And the same thing was true later for
Haydn and for Mozart.

15
00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.710
In the 18th century, there's no such thing
as we Americans would call free agency,

16
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.890
or he's a free agent.

17
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.140
You were, in the 18th century,
an employee for life,

18
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.360
unless your employer
agreed to release you.

19
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.230
And Bach hadn't played by
the rules of the game.

20
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.220
And when he returned from Cöthen to
Weimar to pick up his possessions and

21
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.610
his family of five, the Duke of
Weimar had Bach thrown in jail.

22
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.600
Bach in jail?

23
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.833
[LAUGH] Yes, in the county jail,
for a month,

24
00:01:26.833 --> 00:01:30.587
from early November to early December,
1770.

25
00:01:30.587 --> 00:01:34.804
At which point, Bach was finally released,
both from jail and

26
00:01:34.804 --> 00:01:38.235
his position in Weimar,
and off he went to Cöthen.

27
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.730
So here's Weimar and here we are moving
up to the northeast where we see Cöthen.

28
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.040
And here's the way Cöthen
looked in the mid 17th century.

29
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.020
Now Bach didn't live in the court
buildings that we see in the center here.

30
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.960
But he lived to the west of town
a couple blocks from the court chapel or

31
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.860
court complex to the west.

32
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.260
And here's the moat
around the court castle.

33
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.120
And here's the bridge going across it.

34
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.080
Right, let me see if I can
show it on the screen here.

35
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.110
There we go, right there.

36
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.830
There's the bridge leading
across the moat in Bach's day,

37
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.680
that's he we got to work every day.

38
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.220
And here's how that same bridge
over the moat looks today,

39
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.370
several hundred years later,
how it looked after the communist regime

40
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.320
relinquished East Germany after
the fall of the Berlin Wall.

41
00:02:34.715 --> 00:02:39.368
And, as we can see by this next slide,
immediately thereafter,

42
00:02:39.368 --> 00:02:42.345
Cöthen was in somewhat
of a state of disrepair.

43
00:02:42.345 --> 00:02:46.335
But the first thing the West Germans
started to fix up was this part

44
00:02:46.335 --> 00:02:49.425
of the castle, the court castle.

45
00:02:49.425 --> 00:02:52.845
The rather well known Hall of Mirrors.

46
00:02:52.845 --> 00:02:54.775
It has been restored.

47
00:02:54.775 --> 00:03:00.940
It has been restored because it was
the most Important room in the castle.

48
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.890
This was the center of entertainment and
music for the court and

49
00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.980
it's still used for
concerts that way today.

50
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.260
So let's take a moment now to review
where we stand with regard to JS Bach.

51
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.300
He's in central Germany.

52
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.980
He's married, 35 years old, four children.

53
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.090
He's now a Kapellmeister,
chief musician at court.

54
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.920
He's composing mainly instrumental music,
solo sonatas and suites for

55
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.590
violin and for cello, that sort of thing.

56
00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.070
Composing many pieces in
the genre of concerto grosso.

57
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.230
We'll be hearing the Brandenberg
Concertos, at least bits of them,

58
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.750
in a moment and
he's composing preludes and fugues,

59
00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.990
in a collection called
the Well Tempered Clavier.

60
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.360
Now, we'll come back to the Well
Tempered Clavier in just a minute.

61
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.010
But before the Well Tempered Clavier
reached fruition, it knew an earlier

62
00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.380
life in something called The Keyboard Book
of Wilhelm Friedemann Bach,

63
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.710
which you see on this screen here.

64
00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.870
It's an interesting story
about this particular book.

65
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.720
First of all,
it's at Yale University as you can see.

66
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.550
But Wilheim Friedemann Bach was
the first son of JS Bach, and

67
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.450
since most Bachs were musicians,
it was thought that Bach,

68
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.400
too, should train his
children to be musicians.

69
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.930
Train the next generation.

70
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.430
And to teach young Wilhelm Friedemann.

71
00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.970
And as was the tradition with all
conscientious music teachers at that time,

72
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.440
Bach created a music book for
his child to learn from.

73
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.640
Father Mozart did the same thing for
his daughter Nannerl and son Wolfgang.

74
00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.970
In those days you just couldn't go to the
neighborhood music store and buy music.

75
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.070
It didn't exist.

76
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.650
If you wanted teaching material
you had to create it yourself.

77
00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.760
You had to do so by copying it by hand.

78
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.610
That's what was thought to be good and
useful for your pupil.

79
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.130
So here we have JS Bach
beginning such a book,

80
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.180
showing the boys the names
of the notes and

81
00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:16.790
how to read the various clefs and
how to play the scales and so on.

82
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.170
As mentioned, this entire, very valuable
manuscript, perhaps the most valuable of

83
00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.460
all Bach manuscripts,
is in the library at Yale University.

84
00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:31.900
And the next slide, well, it shows us the
symbols and the signs of the ornaments,

85
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.390
and he introduces his son,
the fledgling keyboard player,

86
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.950
to these signs and symbols, which
are very important In the Baroque Era.

87
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.900
And then he begins to write his succession
of easy to play preludes and fugues.

88
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.740
The most famous of these
being the Prelude in C Major,

89
00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.860
and indeed,
we've actually heard that before.

90
00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.470
And if we turn to the end
of this same prelude,

91
00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.840
we can see that interestingly enough,
the way it appears in its original

92
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.650
version was not exactly as Bach heard
it in his ear in the final version.

93
00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.257
So you know this, this,
prelude, we've all heard it.

94
00:06:12.257 --> 00:06:22.257
[MUSIC]

95
00:06:24.365 --> 00:06:29.278
And then just the last four bars here,

96
00:06:29.278 --> 00:06:32.666
in its original version.

97
00:06:32.666 --> 00:06:42.666
[MUSIC]

98
00:06:45.923 --> 00:06:48.090
Originally Bach ended it right there.

99
00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.690
In the last version that we
know it by today there's a long

100
00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.860
extra sus on the diminished chord,
I believe,

101
00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:58.210
that brings him back to a different
ending of this prelude.

102
00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.530
So what's a prelude?

103
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:05.770
Well, a prelude, of course, is a warm up
piece, gets the fingers limbered up and

104
00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:10.130
relaxed and ready to play the more
substantive piece, the fugue.

105
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:13.080
So let's go on now to
learn about the fugue.

106
00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.790
And we'll do so by means of a class video.

107
00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:20.010
So we want to know about
how fugues operate, so

108
00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:22.550
let's take a look at the specifics here.

109
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:26.810
The term fugue actually comes
from an old Latin word fuga,

110
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.750
which means flight or to fly.

111
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:33.590
So in a fugue,
what you get is one voice going ahead,

112
00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:36.890
leading ahead and
another voice following it.

113
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.530
Now I just used the term voice there.

114
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:44.630
Fugues can be written for
actual voices, sounding voices.

115
00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:50.580
Or they can be written for instruments
such as the violin or the cello.

116
00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:51.652
Individual lines.

117
00:07:51.652 --> 00:07:55.471
It can even be written for
instruments that can play several lines or

118
00:07:55.471 --> 00:07:56.811
several parts at once.

119
00:07:56.811 --> 00:07:59.701
The piano can do that,
the organ can do that, even the guitar.

120
00:07:59.701 --> 00:08:03.040
And occasionally the violin
will be asked to do that.

121
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:07.950
Fugues have been written for
as few as two voices.

122
00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:09.970
Yes, you could have a two voice fugue.

123
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:13.220
Up to as many as 32 voices.

124
00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.550
And they can be, as mentioned,

125
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:26.810
written for, and they are best, perhaps,
performed on, these keyboard instruments

126
00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:32.020
that have the capacity to play many lines,
many parts, many voices at once.

127
00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:36.824
The greatest collection of fugues, as you
may have bumped into or heard about or

128
00:08:36.824 --> 00:08:40.410
at least heard the term,
is this collection of preludes and

129
00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:43.590
fugues by J S Back called
the Well Tempered Clavier.

130
00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:45.090
First of all what's a prelude?

131
00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:46.280
It's just a warm up piece.

132
00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:51.031
[MUSIC]

133
00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:52.315
You sort of get relaxed.

134
00:08:52.315 --> 00:08:55.880
You get a, your fingers get the feel
of the keyboard, or of the lute or

135
00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.210
whatever it might happen to be.

136
00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:59.205
A prelude, a preplay, a warm up.

137
00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:05.680
And then we go on to the meat of
the issue, which is the fugue.

138
00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:09.430
Now why is this called
the well tempered clavier?

139
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:10.480
Anybody know?

140
00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.510
Anybody have, it's an odd term.

141
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:13.920
Clavier just means keyboard.

142
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.510
The well tuned keyboard.

143
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:18.220
Thoughts there?

144
00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:21.530
Well, what was going on in Bach's day is
that they didn't have a keyboard that

145
00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:23.418
[MUSIC]

146
00:09:23.418 --> 00:09:28.022
they didn't have a tuning system in which
all of the pitches were exactly a half

147
00:09:28.022 --> 00:09:29.190
step apart.

148
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:33.562
Some were slightly closer together,
and then others farther apart.

149
00:09:33.562 --> 00:09:37.834
And the key of C [SOUND] actually
had a slightly different sound

150
00:09:37.834 --> 00:09:39.520
than the key of D [SOUND].

151
00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:44.034
And it's only the 18th and
19th century that we gradually shifted

152
00:09:44.034 --> 00:09:47.860
from an unequal keyboard to
an equally tuned keyboard.

153
00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:53.300
So Bach is kind of part of this
transition to the equal tuned keyboard.

154
00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:58.090
He was getting close to the equal
temperament of the modern keyboard.

155
00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:01.970
And that's why he called
it the well tuned keyboard.

156
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:07.480
And by tuning it this way it allows
you to modulate to all keys.

157
00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.376
And that's what he did in this collection.

158
00:10:09.376 --> 00:10:15.305
He wrote two books, one in 17,
about 1722 when he was in Curtin and

159
00:10:15.305 --> 00:10:18.735
another in about 1742
when he was in Leipzig.

160
00:10:18.735 --> 00:10:23.430
And in each of these books we have
a total of 24 preludes and fugues.

161
00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:27.427
One a prelude and
fugue in C major [SOUND].

162
00:10:27.427 --> 00:10:30.048
One prelude and fugue in C minor [SOUND].

163
00:10:30.048 --> 00:10:34.741
One prelude and
fugue in C sharp major [SOUND].

164
00:10:34.741 --> 00:10:37.748
And one prelude and
fugue in C sharp minor [SOUND].

165
00:10:37.748 --> 00:10:40.450
And so on it goes, all the way
up the keyboard in that fashion.

166
00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:41.660
Two books of those.

167
00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:43.970
And this is kind of standard fodder for

168
00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:47.010
those that want to become
professional musicians.

169
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:51.290
Okay.
So that's what that is about.

170
00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:54.690
The well tempered clavier.

171
00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:57.260
We've been referencing Bach here, and

172
00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:01.500
nobody of course wrote
better fugues then J S Bach.

173
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.890
Some continued,
some continued to write fugues.

174
00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:06.140
Mozart wrote some fugues.

175
00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:07.150
Haydn wrote some fugues.

176
00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:09.300
Beethoven wrote some fugues, and so on.

177
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.790
And even into the 20th century
we have a few composers.

178
00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:15.050
Paul Hindemith used to teach at Yale.

179
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:16.750
Dimitri Shostakovich.

180
00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:18.030
They wrote fugues.

181
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:22.070
But, generally speaking,
the fugue has its heyday in the Baroque

182
00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.890
period, roughly 1600 to 1750.

183
00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:28.820
The heyday of Bach and Handel.

184
00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.910
How do fugues work?

185
00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:35.130
Well, they start out, as mentioned,
with one voice leading forward.

186
00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:39.490
And then another voice
imitates that voice, exactly.

187
00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:43.196
Now, if that following voice,
here's a question, if that following

188
00:11:43.196 --> 00:11:47.171
voice imitated the leader exactly from
beginning to end what would we have?

189
00:11:52.088 --> 00:11:53.020
A round.

190
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:53.700
Okay.

191
00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:54.820
Good.
That's what we would have.

192
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:55.420
A round.

193
00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:59.560
Or we could call,
use the fancier music word, a cannon.

194
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.030
Cannon, round, the same thing.

195
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:04.740
One voice imitating the other
exactly from beginning to end.

196
00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:08.190
But in a fugue, what happens is,
after the main idea,

197
00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:13.350
which we'll be calling the subject,
the main idea is stated, then the parts

198
00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:19.380
go their independent ways generating
counterpoint, but they're not exact.

199
00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:24.900
They're not precise duplication of the
rhythms and the pitches of the leaders.

200
00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:30.370
So what we can do would be to visualize
this in a sort of crude way up here.

201
00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:32.710
You have a leader and then a follower.

202
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:36.970
And the follower duplicates the main idea,
which we're gonna call the subject for

203
00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:37.950
a period of time.

204
00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:39.290
But then it kind of breaks off.

205
00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:43.410
So, voices will come in and
duplicate a certain amount of material and

206
00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:46.790
then break off and go their own way.

207
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:49.700
So that's a good way of
thinking of the beginning

208
00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:53.290
of a fugue which we will
call the exposition.

209
00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:55.310
I'll come back to that point in a moment.

210
00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:57.810
Notice here I put a little,
silly little tree up here.

211
00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:01.990
We could say that we have
the genus polyphony here.

212
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:04.380
And we've got monophonic texture,
homophonic texture, and

213
00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:05.290
polyphonic texture.

214
00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:09.300
So, within polyphonic texture we
have non-imitative texture, and

215
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.850
then a stream of imitative polyphony, and

216
00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:17.700
then two forms of imitative polyphony,
rather strict, exactly strict,

217
00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:22.430
imitative polyphony, the canon, and less
strict imitative polyphony, the fugue.

218
00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:25.800
Okay?
Questions about that so far?

219
00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.300
All right.

220
00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.060
Let's go back to
the beginning of the fugue.

221
00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.920
We have this opening melody,

222
00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:35.280
the distinctive part of it which
we're gonna call the subject.

223
00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.940
That's what we call the melody in a fugue,
the subject.

224
00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:40.460
And the way this works is, in a fugue,

225
00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:44.810
each of the voices in turn will
come in with that subject.

226
00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:49.030
One will start out, and another will
come in, then another will come in.

227
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:51.360
After all of the voices are in,

228
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.070
we're at the end of what we call
the exposition of the fugue.

229
00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:57.455
We hear in the fugue we
have just one theme.

230
00:13:57.455 --> 00:14:00.055
But everybody's gonna get
a chance to present it.

231
00:14:00.055 --> 00:14:01.885
And after everyone has
a chance to present it,

232
00:14:01.885 --> 00:14:06.105
every voice has a chance to present it,
then we're finished with the exposition.

233
00:14:06.105 --> 00:14:09.865
All the voices have exposed
the theme in their range.

234
00:14:09.865 --> 00:14:14.205
After that, we go on to what's
called the episode of a fugue.

235
00:14:14.205 --> 00:14:15.765
What happens in an episode?

236
00:14:15.765 --> 00:14:18.130
Well, usually it modulates key.

237
00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:23.730
And the vehicle through which composers
frequently modulate is melodic sequence,

238
00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:24.530
either up or down.

239
00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:27.040
You can kind of move
around by using sequence.

240
00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.410
You can get to different
places by using sequence.

241
00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:35.900
So it tends to be contrapuntal because
it's using little motives from the theme.

242
00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:39.990
It modulates, moves around a lot, goes to
different keys, sounds a bit unsettled.

243
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:44.178
We start out here with the exposition in
which all voices present the subject.

244
00:14:44.178 --> 00:14:48.640
Then you have this kind of free period in
which the motive out of the subjects is

245
00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:51.830
played with, developed,
moved around different pitches.

246
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:54.460
Then the subject will
come back in a new key

247
00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:57.240
because we've modulated it in the episode.

248
00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.220
Subject in just one voice, new key.

249
00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:02.770
Then another episode in which there's
modulation, more counterpoint,

250
00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:04.000
more movement.

251
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.300
Another statement of
the subject in a new key.

252
00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:08.870
Another episode.

253
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:10.220
Another statement of the subject, and

254
00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:13.990
on it goes until we run out of energy
usually about after about four or

255
00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:18.930
five minutes or so, at which point,
the composer will bring the subject back,

256
00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:24.220
maybe in the bass or in the soprano, in
a very prominent range in the tonic key.

257
00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:27.110
And we have the sense,
this is a very solid moment.

258
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:28.920
Yes, this fugue is ending.

259
00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:32.280
And maybe they'll throw upon,
throw one or two chords on at the end.

260
00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.180
But that's it.

261
00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:36.570
That takes care of the fugue, generally.

262
00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:41.430
But let's review now,
by way of a definition,

263
00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:45.010
and by necessity it has to be a long one.

264
00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:47.325
So what's a fugue?

265
00:15:47.325 --> 00:15:52.995
Well, a fugue is a composition with two,
to as many as 32 lines or

266
00:15:52.995 --> 00:15:57.860
parts, whether they be voices or
instruments.

267
00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:00.796
But usually they're instrumental voices.

268
00:16:00.796 --> 00:16:07.060
A Fugue begins with a succession of
statements of the subject in all voices.

269
00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:10.080
That's called as we've seem the exposition

270
00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:14.550
continues with alternations of subject and
free sections.

271
00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:18.980
These episodes using material
derived from the subject.

272
00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.429
The episodes modulate
through different keys.

273
00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:28.040
And ultimately, the subject returns in
the tonic key with a strong affirmation

274
00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.930
of that tonic key.

275
00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:32.690
Now, let's dig in to a few now,

276
00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:38.390
specifically the few from
Bach's Well Tempered Clavier in C minor.

277
00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:43.170
So you see the fugue, the music for
the fugue on the screen up there.

278
00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:48.050
We're going to start upper left
hand side of the page there,

279
00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:52.850
and this particular fugue is written for
three voices.

280
00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:55.750
And we'll call them alto,
soprano and bass.

281
00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:57.960
Starts with the alto voice.

282
00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:58.705
Here's the subject.

283
00:16:58.705 --> 00:17:08.705
>> [MUSIC]

284
00:17:27.907 --> 00:17:33.870
Okay, that takes us page one,
third system, middle of the page there.

285
00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:37.470
So, we've got all three of our
statements of the subject,

286
00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:40.000
that's the end of the exposition.

287
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.080
Now, we have an episode.

288
00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:44.233
I'm going to play just the bottom
part here so we can see.

289
00:17:44.233 --> 00:17:47.265
The melodic sequence.

290
00:17:47.265 --> 00:17:56.557
But episodes modulate.
[MUSIC]

291
00:17:56.557 --> 00:17:58.040
And then so on it goes.

292
00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.049
So, we have a pitch starting here.

293
00:18:00.049 --> 00:18:01.913
[MUSIC]

294
00:18:01.913 --> 00:18:05.772
Each one of those successively
lower degree, the scale,

295
00:18:05.772 --> 00:18:10.808
the effect of that is to take us from
here, minor key up to hear at this point,

296
00:18:10.808 --> 00:18:16.184
this is the fourth system, the subject
comes back, but this time in a major key.

297
00:18:16.184 --> 00:18:23.961
[MUSIC]

298
00:18:23.961 --> 00:18:32.040
And then another modulation
which takes us over to page two.

299
00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:36.520
Now, I want to point out something of
interest here at page two top system.

300
00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.320
Has to do with the episode.

301
00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:41.680
Page two, top system, last two bars.

302
00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:44.950
We have an episode and
we're working with a motive here and

303
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:46.930
the motive sounds this way.

304
00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:47.808
Part A of the motive.

305
00:18:47.808 --> 00:18:52.766
[MUSIC]

306
00:18:52.766 --> 00:18:54.739
And part b up above against it.

307
00:18:54.739 --> 00:18:59.162
[MUSIC]

308
00:18:59.162 --> 00:19:00.930
Okay, a and b.

309
00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:05.530
Now, watch what he does in
the continuation of this episode

310
00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:10.320
in the first bar of the second system,
second system, first bar.

311
00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.895
B is now down below.

312
00:19:11.895 --> 00:19:16.991
[MUSIC]

313
00:19:16.991 --> 00:19:18.975
And A is now up above.

314
00:19:18.975 --> 00:19:24.177
[MUSIC]

315
00:19:24.177 --> 00:19:28.500
So, he's switched the two, we have
what's called invertible counterpoint.

316
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.050
We've inverted these motives.

317
00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:33.073
Okay systems three and four we go through.

318
00:19:33.073 --> 00:19:38.494
[MUSIC]

319
00:19:38.494 --> 00:19:43.958
Another episode,
long melodic sequence takes us down to

320
00:19:43.958 --> 00:19:48.936
bottom system where the bass
comes back in the key.

321
00:19:48.936 --> 00:19:55.692
[MUSIC]

322
00:19:55.692 --> 00:19:59.895
And then we're going to head toward
the end, final drive to the cadence here.

323
00:19:59.895 --> 00:20:06.210
[MUSIC]

324
00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:06.895
Final statement.

325
00:20:06.895 --> 00:20:09.937
[MUSIC]

326
00:20:09.937 --> 00:20:13.013
Of the subject.

327
00:20:13.013 --> 00:20:15.730
And that's how it sounds.

328
00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:16.832
On a harpsichord.

329
00:20:16.832 --> 00:20:19.397
This is a synthesizer
sounding like a harpsichord.

330
00:20:19.397 --> 00:20:24.529
[MUSIC]

331
00:20:24.529 --> 00:20:28.799
But notice the bass has
completely died out.

332
00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:33.013
Bach probably had the sound
of the organ in his ear here,

333
00:20:33.013 --> 00:20:37.354
because we want that tonic note and
some performers actually play it this way.

334
00:20:37.354 --> 00:20:45.968
[MUSIC]

335
00:20:45.968 --> 00:20:48.710
So, we get that tonic
base strongly in our ear.

336
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:51.660
Now, if Bach had performed
this on the organ, and

337
00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:55.810
through the marvels of the modern
synthesizer, I may be able to do this,

338
00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:59.912
play this on something that may
be the sound of a rock organ.

339
00:20:59.912 --> 00:21:00.577
Yes.

340
00:21:00.577 --> 00:21:04.106
[MUSIC]

341
00:21:04.106 --> 00:21:05.540
Hear the bass sounding.

342
00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:13.700
It continues to sound on an organ and
it works on an organ.

343
00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:15.780
It doesn't work so well on a harpsichord.

344
00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:20.280
Well that holding line there
is called a pedal point, and

345
00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:26.188
obviously the term comes from the Baroque
organ process of having a pedal,

346
00:21:26.188 --> 00:21:31.375
usually in the base, hold out as
upper material slides above it.

347
00:21:31.375 --> 00:21:41.375
[MUSIC]

348
00:21:43.229 --> 00:21:45.852
More effective that way.

349
00:21:45.852 --> 00:21:50.848
Okay, well let's review using some
of the terms that we've discussed

350
00:21:50.848 --> 00:21:53.133
in association with the Fugue.

351
00:21:53.133 --> 00:21:58.010
Subject, obviously you know that's the
main theme episode, excuse me, exposition.

352
00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:02.950
Well that's the section in which
the subject is presented in

353
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:07.590
succession in all of the voices at
the beginning of a few episode.

354
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:10.970
Episode is a pre modulatory
section in which

355
00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:13.440
motives out of the subject are derived and

356
00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:18.360
then exploited therein modulation
obviously that's a change of key.

357
00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:21.620
That's what episodes are good at,
getting you from one key to the next.

358
00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:25.300
Melodic sequence, we talked about,
presentation of the mode of

359
00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:29.230
different pitch levels,
it allows the performer to modulate.

360
00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:32.680
And pedal point,
which we were just introduced to,

361
00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:37.190
a sustained note oftentimes in
some sort of tonic fashion and

362
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:43.080
gives a strong sense of the tonality that
particular point along sustained pitch.

363
00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.560
Okay, these are terms for today.

364
00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:47.640
And a final point.

365
00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:51.570
Fugues have always seemed to me
to be somewhat mathematical.

366
00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:55.180
We saw that episode in which the music,
well,

367
00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:57.870
it was first in the bottom,
and then the top.

368
00:22:57.870 --> 00:22:59.460
And then the box switched them around.

369
00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:03.570
They put the top music on the bottom,
and the bottom music on the top.

370
00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:07.100
Well in a sense, you can do the same
sort of thing in mathematics.

371
00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:12.380
These particular parts of this
equation here can be re-shuffled

372
00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:16.650
in any number of different ways, and
the answer will always be the same.

373
00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:19.420
The effect will always be the same.

374
00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:23.000
It's like playing in odd sort of ways,
manipulating I suppose,

375
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.330
Lego's in one fashion or another.

376
00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:31.300
And the same thing happens with the
constructiveness or mathematical design as

377
00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:36.950
I'll call it here in a creation
by Josef Albers entitled Fugue.

378
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:42.540
Josef Albers used to be the dean of the
school of art and architecture at Yale and

379
00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:46.900
he's got the construction
called a Fugue and

380
00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:49.600
then he's got these motives in the Fugue.

381
00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:53.670
Well, we can take these motives and
as I've done here, I've just arbitrarily

382
00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:58.140
duplicated the image and made it go
backwards, just turned it around so

383
00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:02.830
that we have it going forwards and
backwards at the same time.

384
00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:05.060
Does it look any different really, to you?

385
00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:09.760
Does the bottom one have a different
sort of sense of it for you?

386
00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:13.250
And you could do the same thing as
we'll see from the next slide here.

387
00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:19.010
We could flip it upside down and
make it go backwards.

388
00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:21.800
So, we've got to make it going
backwards and then upside down.

389
00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:25.850
You could hang this thing on your wall
any one of three or four ways and

390
00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:27.630
I don't think it would matter a lot.

391
00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:30.980
So, again,
the parts in something as intellectual

392
00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:35.640
constructivist as a fugue can be arranged
in many different sorts of ways.

393
00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:39.439
And how we feel about the composition,
whether visual or

394
00:24:39.439 --> 00:24:42.379
musical really doesn't change very much.
