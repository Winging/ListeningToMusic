00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.463
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:06.463 --> 00:00:10.297
So here we are again in
the hall of mirrors in Cöthen.

3
00:00:10.297 --> 00:00:18.660
Central performance hall of the Prince of
Cöthen anhalt, in the early 18th century.

4
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.220
Bach had just arrived in town and

5
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.270
was placed in charge of
the small court orchestra.

6
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.210
And indeed, he was bulking it up by
means of an active recruiting policy.

7
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.520
He was drawing top musicians to Cöthen,

8
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.300
from important Berlin some
hundred miles to the north.

9
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.170
Bach made a couple of trips
to Berlin in this period.

10
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.696
In one of them he was sent by the Prince
of Cöthen, to acquire and transport back

11
00:00:44.696 --> 00:00:50.590
to Cöthen, a large two manual harpsichord
made by one Michael Mietke in 1719.

12
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:56.090
During these trips to Berlin,
Bach made the acquaintance of the Margrave

13
00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.400
of Brandenburg, one of the relatives of
the King of Prussia, Frederick the Great.

14
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.370
Later, back in Cöthen, but always angling
for a better position, a better job.

15
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.530
Bach gathered up a collection of
six concertos, bound them together,

16
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.100
wrote a flowery and dedication page and
sent them to the Margrave.

17
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.908
Here's some of what Bach's
dedication to the Margrave said.

18
00:01:21.908 --> 00:01:25.220
Well actually [LAUGH] I
can't read it on the screen.

19
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.780
I'm a little bit far away from it,
that doesn't matter.

20
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.040
You've got a closer vision,
view of the slide and you can read it.

21
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.550
But it's written in French,

22
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.830
which was actually the language
of the court in that period.

23
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.930
And it's done in the most
obsequious sort of prose where,

24
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.849
Bach seems to be bending over
backwards to almost prostrate himself,

25
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.339
in order that he can get
this position in Berlin,

26
00:01:49.339 --> 00:01:53.970
impress the Margrave of Brandenburg.

27
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.530
Did it work?

28
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.310
No, apparently the Margrave never
even looked at the collection.

29
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.670
[LAUGH] They sat in a royal
library until the 19th century,

30
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.920
when they were rediscovered.

31
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.580
Bach's fame was finally beginning to grow.

32
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.530
They were rediscovered, but note,
not until the mid 19th century.

33
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.607
Well, let's focus on the fifth of
these six Brandenburg Concertos.

34
00:02:19.607 --> 00:02:24.898
And as you can see here from the slide,
we've got a total of six of them.

35
00:02:24.898 --> 00:02:30.140
They were written in the period 1715 to
1721, and we're gonna focus on Number 5.

36
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.470
It has a Concertino, remember that
it's the little group of soloist,

37
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.590
of solo violin, flute, and harpsichord.

38
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:44.150
Then the Tutti everybody else in this case
about a dozen or so, plus the Concertino.

39
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.870
The Concertino plus everybody
else that equals the Tutti, and

40
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.180
the Tutti plays the ritornello.

41
00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.390
The ritornello has many of the
characteristics of late Baroque melody.

42
00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.290
It's idiomatic writing for the violin and

43
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.730
we'll hear why it's
idiomatic in just a second.

44
00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:09.630
And this particular concerto uses
a cadenza, employs a cadenza at the end.

45
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.770
A showy passage for a soloist,
at the end of a movement,

46
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.650
to showcase his or
her particular technical skills.

47
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.890
And as we'll finally observe here,
this particular movement's a long one.

48
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.476
We're not going to hear all of it,
but it is a long one.

49
00:03:26.476 --> 00:03:30.021
9 minutes in length
compared to 3 minutes in

50
00:03:30.021 --> 00:03:35.710
length to a typical movement of
a Concerto Grosso of Vivaldi.

51
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:41.910
And again, the Margrave put them in a
closet, and they really weren't published,

52
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.568
they didn't become known until 1850,
about 130 years later.

53
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.525
Let's just review again.

54
00:03:48.525 --> 00:03:52.326
Here's a typical layout of
Ritornello form, and as you can see,

55
00:03:52.326 --> 00:03:56.838
it's a very simple idea, where we have
the ritornello played by everybody.

56
00:03:56.838 --> 00:04:01.500
We have this idea of the concertino,
playing excerpts, motis,

57
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.480
out of the ritornello.

58
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.070
It functions very much like an episode,
in a few.

59
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.810
Then the tutti comes back
in with a ritornello.

60
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.410
Concertino comes back in with motis,
derived from the ritornello.

61
00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.820
Tutti, concertino, tutti, concertino.

62
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.360
On it goes.

63
00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:27.120
Now we here we see the autograph
of Bach's original here.

64
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.980
This is Bach's autograph
of the first movement of

65
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.540
Brandenburg Concerto Number Five.

66
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.540
As we look up there in the top score,

67
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.900
we can see that the flute part of
the concertino is actually resting.

68
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.640
Then the solo violin comes in.

69
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.876
And the violin of the full
orchestra of the tutti comes in and

70
00:04:47.876 --> 00:04:52.875
they play this melody, something
very typical of baroque music, and

71
00:04:52.875 --> 00:04:58.744
something very idiomatic to the violin
cuz it can repeat pitches rather quickly.

72
00:04:58.744 --> 00:05:01.960
So it's good at this and
it sounds good on a violin.

73
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.786
[MUSIC]

74
00:05:07.786 --> 00:05:10.670
Well, there I played it on a harpsichord,
or a harpsichord synthesizer.

75
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:11.800
But you get the sense of it.

76
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.340
So here,
you can see the melody of the ritornello.

77
00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.950
We'll be hearing that again,
and again as it returns.

78
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.890
Then, the lower strings,
the second violins, and the violas

79
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:29.150
begin to,
they flesh out the texture underneath.

80
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:34.530
The bottom two systems,
that's the music for the harpsichord.

81
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.260
But notice that the harpsichord again
has no music actually written for

82
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.090
the right-hand score, it's empty.

83
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.640
That's because the performer,
in this case J S Bach himself.

84
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.180
Bach wrote these numbers,
Bach knew what these numbers meant.

85
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.820
And he used those numbers to
flesh out the harmony above.

86
00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.940
Okay, so let's go back now to
our hall of mirrors at Cöthen.

87
00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.710
Here we see it as it exists
today with the seats in place,

88
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.660
and there's even a sculpture of J.S.
Bach over there to the left.

89
00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.716
And now let's hear a performance of this,
and as you listen to this performance,

90
00:06:12.716 --> 00:06:16.759
ask yourself, or I'm asking you,
what's unusual about this?

91
00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:23.994
What goes on in this
performance that we see here,

92
00:06:23.994 --> 00:06:28.820
and probably wouldn't happen in

93
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:34.179
a concert of music in the modern day.

94
00:06:34.179 --> 00:06:35.592
[MUSIC]

95
00:06:35.592 --> 00:06:38.712
Well right off the bat, you can see
that the performers are standing up and

96
00:06:38.712 --> 00:06:39.934
that was actually typical.

97
00:06:39.934 --> 00:06:45.354
The only people sitting down are people
that play cello and harpsichord.

98
00:06:45.354 --> 00:06:46.249
Okay.

99
00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:49.534
Flute [INAUDIBLE] wood flute,
transverse flute.

100
00:06:49.534 --> 00:06:59.799
[MUSIC]

101
00:06:59.799 --> 00:07:04.080
We'll pause it right here and notice how
far this violin's hand is up on the bow.

102
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.230
That's typical of Baroque performance.

103
00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:11.730
It allows for a fast and light style of
playing, which is very different then

104
00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:16.120
the later 19th century style where the
hand puts a lot of pressure on the bow.

105
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.480
Let's continue a while.

106
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.620
So we're now having
the concertino perform.

107
00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.330
We've had the ritornello.

108
00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.220
Now we're having the concertino play.

109
00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:34.220
[MUSIC]

110
00:07:55.565 --> 00:07:56.297
There's the ritornello.

111
00:07:56.297 --> 00:08:00.684
[MUSIC]

112
00:08:00.684 --> 00:08:03.008
and off the concertino goes again.

113
00:08:03.008 --> 00:08:06.615
Soloing out.

114
00:08:06.615 --> 00:08:16.615
[MUSIC]

115
00:08:21.973 --> 00:08:25.874
>> The ritornello again but
in a different key.

116
00:08:25.874 --> 00:08:27.777
All right let's pause it here now.

117
00:08:27.777 --> 00:08:28.438
We're gonna pause it.

118
00:08:28.438 --> 00:08:29.800
Maybe I can pause it.

119
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.050
I'll pause it.

120
00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:33.400
I'm gonna try to move it up.

121
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.300
We'll see where we are.

122
00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:37.895
We're gonna move it all the way over here,

123
00:08:37.895 --> 00:08:42.740
cuz we want to see the harpsichord
gradually begin to take over.

124
00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:46.077
This is the beginning of
the harpsichord cadenza.

125
00:08:46.077 --> 00:08:56.077
[MUSIC]

126
00:09:12.928 --> 00:09:14.132
It might seem easy, but

127
00:09:14.132 --> 00:09:18.361
this is one of the most difficult pieces
in the entire keyboard repertoire to play.

128
00:09:18.361 --> 00:09:27.567
[MUSIC]

129
00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:28.681
And it's a long Cadenza.

130
00:09:28.681 --> 00:09:38.681
[MUSIC]

131
00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.817
As we swing around a trill
on the left hand there.

132
00:09:42.817 --> 00:09:48.946
[MUSIC]

133
00:09:48.946 --> 00:09:49.968
Two manual harpsichord.

134
00:09:49.968 --> 00:09:51.465
[MUSIC]

135
00:09:51.465 --> 00:09:54.704
Notice the upper keys are going up and
down with the bottom one.

136
00:09:54.704 --> 00:09:59.324
That means he's got them coupled,
he's using his two-eights in conjunction.

137
00:09:59.324 --> 00:10:02.900
Sounds like a magic trick,
but there's a reason for it.

138
00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:12.900
[MUSIC]

139
00:10:37.318 --> 00:10:39.141
Now he's playing the upper
of the two-eighths.

140
00:10:39.141 --> 00:10:44.647
[MUSIC]

141
00:10:44.647 --> 00:10:46.284
Coming up chromatically,

142
00:10:46.284 --> 00:10:50.465
[MUSIC]

143
00:10:50.465 --> 00:10:53.849
In a moment you'll hear a pedal point
beginning to bang away underneath.

144
00:10:53.849 --> 00:11:03.849
[MUSIC]

145
00:11:16.644 --> 00:11:17.920
And.

146
00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:18.980
End of cadenza.

147
00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:24.997
Tutti comes back in playing
the ritornello and driving to the end.

148
00:11:24.997 --> 00:11:34.997
[MUSIC]

149
00:11:36.919 --> 00:11:38.750
Wow, quite a workout.

150
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:42.700
Okay let's recap by means of a slide here.

151
00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:49.970
The Brandenburg Concertos, a collection
of six gathered up 17, 21, 17, 21, four.

152
00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:54.900
The Margrave of Brandenburg,
Concerto Grosso.

153
00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:59.340
In genre showing the differentiation
between the concertino and

154
00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:04.090
the tutti that we've talked about
making use of figured bass.

155
00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:07.010
Continuing to exploit the idea
of the basso continuo,

156
00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:09.310
the keyboard accompanied there by a cello.

157
00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:12.807
They're forming the basso
continuo in this movement.

158
00:12:12.807 --> 00:12:17.076
Idiomatic writing we've talked about is
very easy for a violin to go da da da da,

159
00:12:17.076 --> 00:12:20.665
da da da da, da da da da back and
forth very quickly over the string.

160
00:12:20.665 --> 00:12:27.330
So it works well on the violin, and we saw
a splendid example of a lengthy cadenza.

161
00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:32.340
And let us not forget,
it all makes for wonderful music.
