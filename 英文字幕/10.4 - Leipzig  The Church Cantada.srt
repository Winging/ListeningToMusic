00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:09.507
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:09.507 --> 00:00:12.072
In 1723 Bach moved again.

3
00:00:12.072 --> 00:00:16.992
This time to Leipzig for a better job
to be cantor of the city of Leipzig,

4
00:00:16.992 --> 00:00:18.550
the university town.

5
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.940
Free education at that university for
his many sons but not his daughters.

6
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.430
Daughters didn't go to university in
any number until the 19th century.

7
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.540
So here is a slide of
a map showing Leipzig.

8
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.460
And here Kurten, slightly to the north
of Leipzig, Kurten where Bach lived for

9
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.110
six years.

10
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.160
And here's nearby Leipzig
where he moved in 1723.

11
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.170
Now, in 1723 exactly the year
that Bach moved here,

12
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.400
this particular engraving was done.

13
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.590
And here we see the church, front and
center there, the church of Saint Thomas.

14
00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.310
And then to the left the choir school.

15
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.650
Now Bach, let's see if I can
show this with my pointer.

16
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.390
Bach lived here in the choir school,
lower left side there.

17
00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.690
Second floor, he had these two windows
here, and these two windows here and

18
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:15.990
they swung around to the other side.

19
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.750
So there was his apartment complex on
the south side of the choir school.

20
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.540
The job of cantor at Leipzig
was a prestigious post, but

21
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.280
it came with limitations and
onerous duties.

22
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.550
Bach was required to superintend
the music at four churches in Leipzig,

23
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.450
teach the boys music, teach the boys
Latin, prepare all the music for

24
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.130
the nearby university, and perform
music at weddings and funerals as well.

25
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.290
Let me read to you, the oath of office
that Bach swore to the town magistrate

26
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.620
when he assumed the position of cantor.

27
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.340
I have my trusty Bach
reader out here today.

28
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.430
Bach agrees to bring the music

29
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.810
in the principle churches of the town into
good estate to the best of my ability.

30
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.790
Show the honorable and wise council
all proper respect and obedience.

31
00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.070
I'm skipping some here, but going on,

32
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.210
give due obedience to the honorable
inspectors and directors of the school.

33
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.678
Arrange the music that is shall
not last [LAUGH] too long.

34
00:02:21.678 --> 00:02:25.600
[LAUGH] They didn't want Bach's
music to go on too long.

35
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.350
They knew Bach.

36
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.500
They knew what he might do.

37
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.100
That the music not go on too long,
nor that it be too operatic.

38
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.008
No opera praise.

39
00:02:34.008 --> 00:02:37.879
[LAUGH] To treat the boys
in a friendly manner.

40
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.950
Faithfully attend to
the instruction in the school.

41
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.400
Not go out of town without permission.

42
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.460
Always so far as possible walk
with the boys at funerals.

43
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.270
Well it sounds like Bach is more
of a scoutmaster here than he

44
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.610
is the grand artist.

45
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.270
But the most important thing,

46
00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:04.050
the most time consuming thing that Bach
had to do is to compose a new cantata.

47
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.290
It didn't stipulate this.

48
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.810
It was just assumed that he would
compose a new cantata every week.

49
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.080
Compose what is called
a Lutheran church cantata.

50
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.880
But let's look again at Bach's church and
get a sense of where he and

51
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.000
his musicians were situated
while they performed this music.

52
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.743
So here we see this same slide again.

53
00:03:27.743 --> 00:03:31.757
And here we see the boy,
see that little clump there, the boys, and

54
00:03:31.757 --> 00:03:33.610
you know those are choir boys.

55
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:39.620
If you've ever followed the perambulations
of a choir, you can see that they

56
00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.320
always put the smallest boys at the front
and the elderly gentlemen at the back.

57
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.635
So here they come, out of the front door,
the choir school moving across the yard

58
00:03:47.635 --> 00:03:50.371
here, and
they're about to make a left hand turn.

59
00:03:50.371 --> 00:03:53.255
I can assure you that this,
make a left hand turn,

60
00:03:53.255 --> 00:03:55.390
as we'll see by the next slide here.

61
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.069
So they enter the church
at this door here.

62
00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.037
In they come,
they could go right to the high altar, but

63
00:04:02.037 --> 00:04:05.592
far more likely, they're going to
go left up into the choir loft.

64
00:04:05.592 --> 00:04:09.478
So here looking right,
we see the high alter of the church,

65
00:04:09.478 --> 00:04:13.612
but now looking in the other direction,
we see the choir loft.

66
00:04:13.612 --> 00:04:19.029
And here's another slide showing,
I believe, the choir loft,

67
00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:24.642
a fuller view of the choir loft as
it looked in the 19th century on,

68
00:04:24.642 --> 00:04:29.190
with the now late 19th
century Sauer organ up there.

69
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.127
This is what it looked like looking
to the west in the choir loft where

70
00:04:33.127 --> 00:04:34.500
the musicians were.

71
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.410
Now let's see what it
looked like in Bach's day.

72
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:44.670
This is not JS Bach, but this is
an illustration done in Leipzig itself

73
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.960
in 1732 showing musicians in a choir loft.

74
00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.280
And it gives you a sense of what
was going on in a church choir loft

75
00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.260
at this time as a Lutheran church
service unfolds with the musicians.

76
00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.970
So here we see the continuo
here with the organ now, and

77
00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:11.020
a cello, and a group of violinists
holding the violin bow as we see,

78
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.250
as we saw before in the video, and
then some brass instruments up here.

79
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:21.030
And they're all playing as stipulated
a Lutheran Church cantata.

80
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.000
So what's a cantata?

81
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.831
Well, as you can see,
a cantata is a kind of mini-musical drama,

82
00:05:27.831 --> 00:05:30.261
about 30 minutes in duration.

83
00:05:30.261 --> 00:05:34.424
It's made up of movements,
movements consisting of arias,

84
00:05:34.424 --> 00:05:36.630
recitatives, and choruses.

85
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.460
In Germany in particular,
it had a spiritual theme.

86
00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.930
And usually,
it was based on a chorale tune.

87
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.210
So obviously, the question is,
what then is a chorale tune?

88
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:56.540
Well, a chorale tune is simply
a straightforward melody on

89
00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:02.120
a sacred text to be sung by
the congregation, sung by everybody.

90
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.000
Some of these chorale tunes are centuries
old, drawn from old Gregorian chant.

91
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.600
Some of them were newly composed,

92
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.770
as early as the 16th century
by Martin Luther himself.

93
00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.780
A Mighty Fortress is Our God is
perhaps the most famous one.

94
00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.258
Some of them were popular songs.

95
00:06:19.258 --> 00:06:23.784
What would happen is they would take
a pop song, strip the pop lyrics off it,

96
00:06:23.784 --> 00:06:25.784
and assign it religious lyrics.

97
00:06:25.784 --> 00:06:31.540
As Luther himself famously said, why
should the devil have all the good tunes?

98
00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:36.390
So he took those good tunes and
he put them to, in his mind, good use.

99
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:41.228
And these chorale tunes are strophic,
strophic in a sense, of course,

100
00:06:41.228 --> 00:06:43.940
that they are made up of stanzas of text.

101
00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:50.990
Well, here is the famous portrait of
Martin Luther, painted by Lucas Cranach.

102
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:55.890
It's today in the Saint Anne Church in
Augsburg where Luther spent some time.

103
00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:00.978
And to the right we see a chorale
tune composed by Luther,

104
00:07:00.978 --> 00:07:06.172
A Mighty Fortress is our God,
with the tune here up on top,

105
00:07:06.172 --> 00:07:09.146
and four strophes of text below.

106
00:07:09.146 --> 00:07:15.518
Let me just play this for you to remind
you what a Lutheran chorale sounds like.

107
00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:25.518
[MUSIC]

108
00:07:31.748 --> 00:07:34.046
Likely you've heard that.

109
00:07:34.046 --> 00:07:41.562
Okay, so that's the first phrase of Martin
Luther's A Mighty Fortress is our God.

110
00:07:41.562 --> 00:07:46.750
Now, let's see how a chorale or
hymn tune can be

111
00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:53.250
used inside of a cantata to
give structure to that cantata.

112
00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:55.397
So, let's turn on to our next slide here.

113
00:07:55.397 --> 00:07:59.496
We'll be working with the cantata,
Wacht auf, ruft uns die Stimme.

114
00:07:59.496 --> 00:08:03.896
Awake, A Voice is Calling,
you can see the date there, 1731.

115
00:08:03.896 --> 00:08:09.170
It was written for a Sunday before Advent,
indeed the fourth Sunday before Advent.

116
00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:12.190
So that means roughly four
Sundays before Christmas.

117
00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:17.930
It is based on a traditional
chorale of the Lutheran Church

118
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:21.772
made up of seven movements,
which is not unusual.

119
00:08:21.772 --> 00:08:26.355
And movements 1, 4, and 7 use the chorale

120
00:08:26.355 --> 00:08:30.830
tune as you can see here.

121
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:34.350
So the chorale begins with stanza one and

122
00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:37.730
then the next time you hear the chorale
you get stanza two of the text and

123
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:43.380
next time we hear the chorale,
we actually get stanza three of the text.

124
00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:46.560
So it provides a kind of
symmetrical structure for it.

125
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:50.690
The text keeps changing, but
the chorale tune doesn't.

126
00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:57.450
Between stanzas of the chorale tune
come pairs of recitative and aria,

127
00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:03.530
setting newly composed text which talks of
the love between Christ and his people.

128
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:09.971
Now let's take a look at this
chorale tune in particular here.

129
00:09:09.971 --> 00:09:14.590
This is a chorale tune dating
back to the 16th century.

130
00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:18.690
Awake, His Voice is Calling,
is written in seven phrases.

131
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:22.680
it has an overall structure of A, A, B.

132
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.860
Which also is standard for chorale tunes.

133
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:29.290
We get phrases one, two, and three, and
then one, two, and three again, and

134
00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:34.240
then four, five, six, and seven, and
three comes back to round off that melody.

135
00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:39.020
Let me play a bit of this for
you at the keyboard here.

136
00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.357
Oh, well,
maybe I'll play it over here off this end.

137
00:09:41.357 --> 00:09:51.357
[MUSIC]

138
00:09:56.715 --> 00:09:57.749
Here's phase three.

139
00:09:57.749 --> 00:10:03.855
[MUSIC]

140
00:10:03.855 --> 00:10:05.771
Then that repeats, so here is one.

141
00:10:05.771 --> 00:10:10.090
[MUSIC]

142
00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:10.855
Two.

143
00:10:10.855 --> 00:10:15.349
[MUSIC]

144
00:10:15.349 --> 00:10:16.045
And three.

145
00:10:16.045 --> 00:10:19.933
[MUSIC]

146
00:10:19.933 --> 00:10:23.170
And then it goes on from there.

147
00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:29.830
Let's take a quick look again
at our seven movement format,

148
00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:32.070
I think we'll see that on the next slide.

149
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:34.280
Here we have our seven movement format.

150
00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:39.640
And we're going to start
off with movement one.

151
00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:43.600
How does the cantata work within
the framework of the Lutheran Sunday

152
00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.850
church service?

153
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:47.490
Well, that service was the civic
high point of the week.

154
00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:50.560
It was partly religious and

155
00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:56.120
partly a social event, was the time when
people of similar beliefs got together.

156
00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.900
And it was a long service,

157
00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:01.580
running from about 7 in
the morning to 11 in the morning.

158
00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:06.630
And it could be dark and cold in the
winter, no central heating in those days.

159
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:09.240
So here you can see the essential events,

160
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:13.820
the high points of the service with their
reading of the gospel from the pulpit.

161
00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:18.600
This was the essential
spiritual message of the day.

162
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:23.300
Then came the cantata which was
a commentary on the spiritual message but

163
00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:24.350
in music.

164
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:29.610
Then came the sermon which was a
commentary on the same spiritual message,

165
00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:32.870
again in words,
in the words of the preacher.

166
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:34.654
That sermon went on for about an hour.

167
00:11:34.654 --> 00:11:40.150
So scripture, cantata, sermon.

168
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:45.070
Now, let's read a bit of the scripture for

169
00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:48.180
the day,
to give a sense of what this is all about.

170
00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:53.070
So here's the gospel Matthew, then
shall the kingdom of heaven be likened

171
00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:57.930
unto ten virgins, which took their lamps
and went forth to meet the bridegroom.

172
00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:01.050
And five of them were wise and
five were foolish.

173
00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:05.320
They that were foolish took their
lamps but took no oil with them.

174
00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.580
And at midnight there was made a cry.

175
00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:12.970
Behold, the bridegroom cometh,
go ye out to meet him.

176
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:17.520
And then all those virgins arose, and
trimmed their lamps and so on it goes.

177
00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:20.950
Well obviously this is a parable
about the wise and foolish and

178
00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:24.310
virgins who's wise were prepared, and

179
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:29.270
the message to those good citizens
of Leipzig was, get your spiritual

180
00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:34.590
house in order because the Lord is about
to arrive, will arrive on Christmas Day.

181
00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:38.260
Let's listen to a performance
of this cantata.

182
00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:44.200
But let's first review, with the aid of
the slide, the structure of the cantata.

183
00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:48.600
So here we have the seven movements, and
we're going to start off with the first

184
00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.750
movement, which the chorus will
be singing the chorale tune.

185
00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:55.520
You'll hear it up on high
in the female voices.

186
00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:58.500
The chorus will be
singing the chorale tune.

187
00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:01.417
And here, just to remind us
the way that chorale tune goes.

188
00:13:01.417 --> 00:13:06.897
[MUSIC]

189
00:13:06.897 --> 00:13:11.487
All right, so
let's go on now to have our video

190
00:13:11.487 --> 00:13:15.861
with Ton Koopman performing in Amsterdam.

191
00:13:15.861 --> 00:13:24.474
[MUSIC]

192
00:13:24.474 --> 00:13:30.953
So, they're playing [FOREIGN].

193
00:13:30.953 --> 00:13:34.924
Notice the strange woodwind instrument,
the low oboe.

194
00:13:48.251 --> 00:13:50.016
And here comes the chorale tune.

195
00:13:53.092 --> 00:13:55.971
Up in the soprano part.

196
00:13:55.971 --> 00:13:57.573
Like a beacon on high.

197
00:14:00.556 --> 00:14:01.752
The word of the Lord.

198
00:14:07.197 --> 00:14:09.715
There's that interesting low oboe again.

199
00:14:13.697 --> 00:14:15.056
Phrase two of the chorale.

200
00:14:25.493 --> 00:14:31.193
Panning around where
the falsetto altos [INAUDIBLE].

201
00:14:31.193 --> 00:14:33.816
Notice how high his hand is on that bow.

202
00:14:36.614 --> 00:14:39.609
Bassoon of course.

203
00:14:39.609 --> 00:14:42.651
Phrase three of the chorale.

204
00:14:42.651 --> 00:14:45.134
[FOREIGN] Wake up, heads up.

205
00:15:00.006 --> 00:15:04.355
And now all of this repeats because
we said it was in A, A, B form but

206
00:15:04.355 --> 00:15:06.400
we're going to pause it here.

207
00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:11.940
Let's go on to explore the core
movement of the cantata.

208
00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:17.230
And by far the most famous movement of
this cantata, movement number four.

209
00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:23.535
Here in movement four the chorale tune
returns with stanza two of the text.

210
00:15:23.535 --> 00:15:26.930
[FOREIGN], Zion hears
the Daughters singing.

211
00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:32.210
But the music doesn't
start with the chorale.

212
00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:35.866
But rather it starts with
another instrumental ritornello,

213
00:15:35.866 --> 00:15:37.970
an instrumental refrain.

214
00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:40.860
And this one is
a particularly beautiful one.

215
00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:45.255
You can see it on
the screen up here on top.

216
00:15:45.255 --> 00:15:50.507
And then after the ritornello
is played through,

217
00:15:50.507 --> 00:15:53.265
the chorale tune enters.

218
00:15:53.265 --> 00:15:59.918
But this time, it enters in unison,
all the male voices singing here together.

219
00:15:59.918 --> 00:16:05.146
So, let me play this, and we'll start
out with the instrumental ritornello,

220
00:16:05.146 --> 00:16:08.130
and then the chorale tunes come in.

221
00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:11.320
Think about this,
Bach has a beautiful melody here.

222
00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:15.730
He had a pre-existing beautiful melody
here, and now, he combines the two.

223
00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:26.920
[MUSIC]

224
00:16:44.333 --> 00:16:48.753
You hear the bass moving
along as Baroque basses do,

225
00:16:48.753 --> 00:16:53.780
almost plodding along,
a walking bass, as it's called.

226
00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:58.598
[MUSIC]

227
00:16:58.598 --> 00:16:59.600
Here comes the chorale.

228
00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:09.933
[MUSIC]

229
00:17:09.933 --> 00:17:11.670
Ritornello continues underneath.

230
00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:23.030
[MUSIC]

231
00:17:29.852 --> 00:17:32.430
And then it repeats, so here we go.

232
00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:34.610
Back to the beginning with the ritornello.

233
00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:40.580
That's a very beautiful passage, a very
beautiful movement and actually the only

234
00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:46.030
one that Bach ever published among these
chorale movements in his own lifetime.

235
00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:49.640
Finally to the last movement,
the grand finale.

236
00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:56.580
So now we've moved on to movement seven,
and

237
00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:02.290
we have the third stanza of
the chorale text being sung here.

238
00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:06.940
The entire congregation actually
sings the chorale tune at this point.

239
00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:09.410
Everybody presumably standing and

240
00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:14.710
affirming the rightness of their
religion and faith in their community.

241
00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:21.100
The community bonds as we said
in session one of our course.

242
00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:24.810
The community bonds through music.

243
00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:29.670
So let's take a look at what's happening
in terms of the music at this point,

244
00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:31.260
as we'll see on the next slide.

245
00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:40.260
This was the emotional high point,
the conclusion of the cantata.

246
00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:44.580
And you can see that it is
written in homophonic style.

247
00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:48.500
Simple homophonic style with
the chorale tune up above.

248
00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:54.681
[MUSIC]

249
00:18:54.681 --> 00:18:58.698
But everybody singing presumably
the soprano, but maybe a clever bass,

250
00:18:58.698 --> 00:19:01.634
knowing how to sing the bass
would have sung the bass.

251
00:19:01.634 --> 00:19:05.435
And all of the instruments and

252
00:19:05.435 --> 00:19:10.452
everybody in the chorus would have been

253
00:19:10.452 --> 00:19:15.477
coming along in the homophonic style.

254
00:19:15.477 --> 00:19:19.457
[MUSIC]

255
00:19:19.457 --> 00:19:21.402
And on it will go.

256
00:19:21.402 --> 00:19:26.902
So again, this is the spiritual
high point of this entire cantata,

257
00:19:26.902 --> 00:19:28.645
the final movement.

258
00:19:28.645 --> 00:19:30.272
Let's give a listen.

259
00:19:30.272 --> 00:19:40.272
[MUSIC]

260
00:19:55.437 --> 00:19:56.820
Then it starts to repeat.

261
00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:59.395
[MUSIC]

262
00:19:59.395 --> 00:20:01.601
And on it goes.

263
00:20:01.601 --> 00:20:06.157
To sum up, what makes Bach's music great?

264
00:20:06.157 --> 00:20:12.310
Why is he rated by many the number
one composer of all time?

265
00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:15.880
Well, let's review by
means of a slide here.

266
00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:19.930
First of all, his music is universal.

267
00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:24.670
He wrote in all genres of
music in his day except opera.

268
00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:28.650
He was too religious a man,
I suppose, to do that.

269
00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:31.270
Clearly, the greatest
contrapuntalist who every lived.

270
00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:32.960
Music sounds great, but

271
00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:37.020
it's perhaps even greater than
it sounds if that is possible.

272
00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:41.679
It has contrapuntal craftsmanship and
integrity to it.

273
00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:47.320
Bach's sound is not only densely
packed with counterpoint, but

274
00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:53.970
can be grandiose, even majestic as we
heard here with the finale of our cantata.

275
00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:56.850
It's also extremely lyrical at times,

276
00:20:56.850 --> 00:21:00.830
as we heard with movement
four of our cantata.

277
00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:04.980
So Bach combines counterpoint and
grandeur and lyricism.

278
00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:10.110
The scale of Bach's works are enormous.

279
00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:11.470
He doesn't take shortcuts.

280
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:15.210
Movement of a Bach concerto
grosses such as we saw there at

281
00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:18.340
the first movement of
Brandenburg Concerto number five

282
00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:23.520
is three times longer than a comparable
one in a movement of Vivaldi.

283
00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:28.230
Universality, counterpoint,
craftsmanship, grandeur, integrity.

284
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:31.789
These are the things that
make Bach's music great.
