[MUSIC]

2
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:17.718
When Bach first came to Leipzig in 1723
he was in middle-age, ambitious and

3
00:00:17.718 --> 00:00:19.970
active and he worked hard.

4
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.820
Writing a new cantata about 30 minutes of
music every work that's a lot of work and

5
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.600
Bach got tired of it.

6
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.155
Hence, toward the end of his life he
went into, in effect, phased retirement.

7
00:00:32.155 --> 00:00:38.600
[LAUGH] Working on only a few
esoteric contrapuntal projects.

8
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.880
But would producing a new cantata
every week really have worn out Bach?

9
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.570
What was the most onerous,
most difficult, most demanding aspect of

10
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.280
producing 30 minutes of music,
30 new minutes of music every week?

11
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.550
Composing the music copying the music,
or rehearsing the music?

12
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:00.310
What do you think?

13
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.410
In terms of time, copying,
writing music down and

14
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.090
copying all the parts that was
probably the most time consuming part.

15
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.950
Here for
example is the autograph of a full score.

16
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.250
Of the opening page of an early cantata by
Bach, by my count there are 20 instruments

17
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.560
and voices performing here, 20 lines and
each measure goes by in about two seconds.

18
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.080
So you might have a thousand, easily
a thousand measures of music in a cantata.

19
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.810
So you have to create this page,
the master score and then you'll have to

20
00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.100
then have all the individual parts copied,
parts for the strings,

21
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.890
parts for the woodwinds, parts for
the voices and so on that's a lot of work.

22
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.640
Where was all this done?

23
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.120
Well, in the church choir school,
where Bach lived and Bach worked.

24
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.690
And this is how it worked in 1723,

25
00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.290
Bach worked here as he saw,
I just think I can show you the cursor.

26
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.330
On the south end of the choir school.

27
00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.050
And I want you to count the number of
stories in this building before we

28
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.380
reach the roof line.

29
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.635
One, two, three okay, three story.

30
00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:23.111
Now, this is how that building looked,
that same building, looked from 1735 on.

31
00:02:23.111 --> 00:02:28.830
There we have it count
the number of stories now.

32
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.050
One, two, three, four, five.

33
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.780
In 1735, they lifted up the roof and
added two stories to this building.

34
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:40.350
They did so

35
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:46.350
to create, in large measure, more
space for Bach because they needed it.

36
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.050
Inside the school where Bach's very
numerous children, in totally he had 20.

37
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.300
Various relatives and a couple of boarding
students, fee-paying boarding students.

38
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.160
This was, this building was
the corporate headquarters of Bach Ink.

39
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.270
But most important, working in this
building was Bach's wife, Anna Magdalena.

40
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:14.100
So here, we see a slide it may or
may not, be an Anna Magdalena.

41
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.650
Bach, we can't be sure,
but she was a musician,

42
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:23.010
a talented singer, but she couldn't sing,
in Bach's time, in Leipzig.

43
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.070
No woman sang in church,

44
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:31.100
in these Lutheran churches in this
period in Bach's religious Leipzig.

45
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.960
But, she was Bach's principal
handmaiden as a copiest.

46
00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.930
Now here, you're about to see
a famous manuscript that she

47
00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.830
copied Anna Bach's
unaccompanied cello suites.

48
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.480
On the left you see, [INAUDIBLE] We're
just going to listen to this music and

49
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.460
I'm going to talk about this music for
a little.

50
00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.539
So here's Anna Magdalena's.

51
00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:55.428
[MUSIC]

52
00:03:55.428 --> 00:04:00.680
Hand over here and
here's her husband's hand over here and

53
00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.150
they're virtually identical.

54
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.696
She taught him much about music.

55
00:04:06.696 --> 00:04:10.070
And, undoubtedly, her style,

56
00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:15.450
her style of calligraphy was influenced by
him to the point that they're virtually.

57
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:21.085
Indistinguishable and sometimes scholars
had difficulty telling the two apart.

58
00:04:21.085 --> 00:04:23.544
[MUSIC]

59
00:04:23.544 --> 00:04:29.356
Well, when old Bach died in 1750 he
was buried in a local parish church

60
00:04:29.356 --> 00:04:35.850
no one paid much attention to him or his
music, then something strange happened.

61
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.510
Around 1830, Bach's unappreciated
music was rediscovered in part by

62
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.590
Felix Mendelsohn, and
it rightly became usually popular.

63
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.030
The good citizens of Leipzig,

64
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.460
had begun to realize that they'd
had in their midst a genius.

65
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.070
So what did they do?

66
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.740
They dug him up to measure his skull.

67
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.290
What?
[LAUGH] Measure his skull?

68
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.980
Well, measure his skull, yes because
at the end of the 19th century,

69
00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.520
some scientists, one might say mad
scientists, had a theory that having

70
00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:16.220
a diminished size skull,
being microcephalic, was a mark of genius.

71
00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:21.550
So they dug him up, measured his skull,
and found it to be completely normal.

72
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:23.670
Now what to do?

73
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.950
Well, capitalize on the event.

74
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.960
So, instead of putting Bach back
in an outlying parish church.

75
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.810
Why not give him a place of
prominence that he deserves?

76
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.280
Bury him at the high
altar as you see here and

77
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.470
that's what the plaque is here,
the high altar of the St. Thomas Church.

78
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.620
Today the most important
church in the life saving.

79
00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.800
And while we're at it here at
the end of the 19th century why not

80
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.930
make a real shrine to Bach?

81
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.980
Let's put in a huge stained glass window
a Bach, with references to his music so

82
00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.350
that tourists,
musical tourists like you and

83
00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:04.180
like me will visit Leipzig, inveterate
the late, great Bach, the church becoming

84
00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:09.750
something akin to a musical hall of fame,
and that's exactly what happened.

85
00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.140
So, if you ever have the chance,
go there, it's actually worth the trip,

86
00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.330
and you'll hear and
enjoy a lot of great music by Bach.
