2
00:00:04.968 --> 00:00:07.620
What a contrast between Bach and Handel.

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.180
The two formal portraits in this
opening slide tells us much.

4
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.910
Bach is dressed modestly, holding
a contrapuntal canon, smallish sized,

5
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.040
something that only the musicians,
who played it could appreciate.

6
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.070
Handel, on the other hand,
is dressed in the finery of a wealthy man.

7
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.326
Looking confident and
holding a large score of Messiah,

8
00:00:32.326 --> 00:00:36.682
the grand public piece intended
to be heard by the masses.

9
00:00:36.682 --> 00:00:39.301
[MUSIC]

10
00:00:39.301 --> 00:00:42.187
As we saw at the end of our last session,

11
00:00:42.187 --> 00:00:47.890
when Bach died in 1750 his
music languished in obscurity,.

12
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.840
After Handel's death on the other hand,
Handel's reputation only grew in renown.

13
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.800
He became postmortem the most
famous composer in the west.

14
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.730
Bach worked in church choir lofts
in small to mid sized German towns.

15
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.300
Handel worked in large theaters,
in the largest and

16
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.245
most prosperous city in the western world,
London.

17
00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:16.885
And generally speaking,
Bach sought integrity,

18
00:01:16.885 --> 00:01:21.205
even perfection,
in the internal workings of his music.

19
00:01:21.205 --> 00:01:24.735
He often wrote on his music scores,
AMGD, ad

20
00:01:26.425 --> 00:01:31.355
maiorem gloriam Dei,
to the greater glory of God.

21
00:01:32.755 --> 00:01:37.260
Handel on the other hand seems to have
been more concerned about those on

22
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.520
this earth.

23
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.580
He seemed to have composed to
achieve the greatest effect with

24
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.564
the greatest number of
citizens of the day.

25
00:01:44.564 --> 00:01:48.039
And that, he accomplished.

26
00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:53.140
Let's begin with this same map with
which we started our discussion of Bach,

27
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.160
that of eighteenth century Germany.

28
00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:01.134
Let's go to Leipzig where Bach resided and
only forty miles to the north to where

29
00:02:01.134 --> 00:02:05.589
is and where Bach resided for
six years before coming to Leipzig.

30
00:02:05.589 --> 00:02:10.474
And in between them,
then, as now, is Halle.

31
00:02:10.474 --> 00:02:14.921
Here, Handel was born in 1685,
the same year as Bach.

32
00:02:14.921 --> 00:02:17.881
Handel's father was a barber surgeon.

33
00:02:17.881 --> 00:02:19.653
In effect, a medical man,

34
00:02:19.653 --> 00:02:23.514
who first prevented his talented
son from studying music.

35
00:02:23.514 --> 00:02:29.356
But then relented, providing him
with music teachers on the organ,

36
00:02:29.356 --> 00:02:33.797
violin, and in music theory,
music composition.

37
00:02:33.797 --> 00:02:42.250
At the age of 18, Handel moved on his
financial own to the port city of Hamburg.

38
00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.030
Here we see Hamburg in the 18th century,

39
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.260
a thriving,
waterfront city on the North Sea.

40
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.160
Handel was employed here as
a second violinist in the orchestra

41
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.450
of the Hamburg opera.

42
00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:02.000
But knowing then that Italy was the center
of opera and all things musical generally,

43
00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.640
Handel began a four
year long tour of Italy

44
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.493
moving to Florence and then to Rome
where he spent most of his time and

45
00:03:12.493 --> 00:03:17.040
ultimately, to a few months to Venice
where he embraced Italian opera, but

46
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.670
most of the time as we've
said Handel was in Rome.

47
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.380
Here we see one of the palaces at
which he was sometimes employed.

48
00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.810
It was the palaces of the noblemen, and

49
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.030
of the princes of the church,
mostly cardinals.

50
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.720
And they sponsored weekly concerts of
sacred operas and sacred cantatas.

51
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.080
On the screen is one of the more
important of the Roman palaces,

52
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.880
the palace of the Cancellaria,
run by the Ottoboni family,

53
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.520
and that palace is still very
much in downtown Rome today, and

54
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.110
this was where one of Hildo's
largest religious works,

55
00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.490
the Resurrection was performed in 1708.

56
00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.180
Ultimately having assimilated
the Italian vocal style,

57
00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.810
Handel made his way to Venice,
where he produced an opera.

58
00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.700
And where somewhat by accident,

59
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.640
he met representatives of the court of the
Elector of Hanover, based back in Germany.

60
00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.380
And Handel was offered a job there.

61
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.400
And he accepted.

62
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.680
So now at age 25,
having made the grand tour of Italy,

63
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.300
Hendell was back in Germany but
he did it then, a cheeky thing.

64
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:38.320
He immediately asked for a leave of
absence to visit London and off he goes.

65
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.790
London, with a population of more than
500,000 in the early 18th century,

66
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.490
was the largest city in Europe,
a growing center of commerce and

67
00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.560
trade and hence of wealth.

68
00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.550
As Handel's German friend, and

69
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.990
they were good friends, Johan Matheson
famously said, in France and

70
00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.830
Italy there is something to learn, but
in London, there is something to earn.

71
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:10.850
Handel intended to earn by
importing Italian opera to London,

72
00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.260
just as fashionistas
import Ferragamo shoes or

73
00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.220
Prada handbags to London or
to New York today.

74
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.770
So Handel went to London
in 1710 to sell opera.

75
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.630
But before we delve into that,
let's pause for a moment and see how

76
00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:33.130
it came to be that Handel's
master back in Germany,

77
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:38.280
the Elector of Hanover,
caught up with Handel in London.

78
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.730
It makes for an interesting story.
