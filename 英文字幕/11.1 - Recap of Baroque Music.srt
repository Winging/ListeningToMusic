2
00:00:09.421 --> 00:00:11.720
Welcome back.

3
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.810
Before we continue with our enjoyment with
the music Bach and Handel, let's take

4
00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.470
a minute to review what we've discovered
thus far for late Baroque music.

5
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.560
Here we were coming out of
the Renaissance and into the Baroque.

6
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.060
Renaissance music by way of
review was chant inspired,

7
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.180
imitative was the basis of the style.

8
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.610
Most of the music was religious music,
it was predominantly vocal music,

9
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.336
it was performed acapella,

10
00:00:43.336 --> 00:00:48.725
which if you remember,
was music performed without instruments.

11
00:00:48.725 --> 00:00:50.860
Then we had these three types of music or

12
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.369
three genres of music,
mass, motet, and madrigal.

13
00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.920
When we come into the 17th
century with the Baroque period,

14
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.960
we have the Jean Rousseau concerto grosso,
fugues and

15
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.730
cantatas and oratorios and
operas, that sort of thing.

16
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.240
It's predominately instrumental.

17
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.360
Violin becomes the leading instrument.

18
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.060
The melodies, generally,
are long and symmetrical.

19
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.360
Strong base line is set
by a basso continuo and

20
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.790
the harpsichord is part
of that basso continuo.

21
00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.030
Rhythms are repetitious.

22
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.970
Music chugs along, even drives along,
in an energetic fashion.

23
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.220
And there is a single ethos or mood.

24
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.650
Once a mood is set in a piece,
it doesn't change.

25
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.240
It stays there from beginning to end.

26
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.780
Let's turn now to a slide of some
music of this period, music of Handel.

27
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.560
It's his famous Largo.

28
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.296
Actually, it's an aria out of his opera,
Xerxes, written in 1738.

29
00:01:58.296 --> 00:02:00.171
Let me play a bit of it.

30
00:02:00.171 --> 00:02:10.171
[MUSIC]

31
00:02:41.004 --> 00:02:43.375
Well the tempo is consistent.

32
00:02:43.375 --> 00:02:44.580
There's a slow beat here.

33
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.910
The beat is consistent in its duration.

34
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:53.110
The dynamic level is constant and
the music moves on sort of nonstop.

35
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.080
One mood, beginning to end.

36
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.630
Now, some music of Bach.

37
00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.850
A violin concerto but done in the style
that we might call Bach rock.

38
00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.894
Two performers on the Chinese erhu,

39
00:03:04.894 --> 00:03:09.420
in what way is this music Baroque and
what way is it not?

40
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:19.420
[MUSIC]

41
00:03:37.337 --> 00:03:40.270
You hear the long musical line,
that melody is still going on.

42
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.950
Why it works, in part,
is because of Baroque rhythm.

43
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.649
It's usually driving and
consistent, and so is the pounding,

44
00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:54.270
driving, consistent music and
the rhythm of much rock music.

45
00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.140
And a lot of pop music
