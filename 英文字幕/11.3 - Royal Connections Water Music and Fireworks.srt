[MUSIC]

2
00:00:06.897 --> 00:00:10.498
Today we're going to look at
the English Royal Family,

3
00:00:10.498 --> 00:00:15.403
the matronly Queen Elizabeth II,
Prince Charles, the photogenic Duke and

4
00:00:15.403 --> 00:00:20.970
Duchess of Cambridge and their son
baby George, the future King George.

5
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.220
It's perhaps amusing to realize that this
current Baby George is a direct descendent

6
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.510
of Gayhard Ludvig Van Hanover,
the elector of Hanover

7
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:37.460
who is Handel's patron, and who became
in 1714 King George I of England.

8
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.780
Why a seemingly obscure German prince was
picked by Parliament to be the king of

9
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.090
England has to do with Parliament's
fear oddly enough of Catholics.

10
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.370
When the throne fell vacant in 1714,
parliament looked to

11
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.880
the closest male Protestant in line for
the English throne, and they found him.

12
00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.770
An obscure German Lutheran
who spoke no English, and

13
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.810
they elevated him to King of England.

14
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:10.560
So there was trueth Handel in London
when he supposed to be back in Hanover.

15
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.050
And lo and behold, his patron comes
from Germany to London in 1714 and

16
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.470
becomes King George I.

17
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.860
But fortunately,
the new king bore Handel no grudge.

18
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.438
And in fact George appointed Handel
the music teacher to his wife, the queen.

19
00:01:27.438 --> 00:01:33.220
And thereafter, Handel served as de
facto English Royal Court Composer,

20
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.940
writing music for coronations.

21
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.200
And some of that coronation music
has been used at every English

22
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.650
coronation since then.

23
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.810
And, Handel wrote music for funerals,
and for victories, and battle, and

24
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.690
for birthdays, and for
public entertainment, generally.

25
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.610
Sometimes in the history of the English
monarchy, the royal family seems to be

26
00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.320
in favor, as with the very buff looking
Duke and Duchess of Cambridge here.

27
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.410
But at other times, the monarchy
seems to have needed a bit of boost.

28
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.770
Queen Elizabeth II, for example, more than
once invited pop musicians Elton John and

29
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.170
Paul McCartney and, to Buckingham Palace,

30
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.220
offering public concerts outside for
the general populace to enjoy.

31
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.460
But this tradition goes all
the way back to Handel, and

32
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.660
specifically to the water music, and

33
00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:32.004
the music of the royal fireworks that
Handel created for George I and his son.

34
00:02:32.004 --> 00:02:36.170
Let's start with the water music.

35
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.310
In the summer of 1717,

36
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.130
the English court commissioned a nautical
entertainment with music by Handel.

37
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.330
One fine summer evening, the king and

38
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.610
his courtiers went up stream in one
large barge, while behind them,

39
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.840
in another, came Handel's musicians,
about 50 in number.

40
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.360
As they went, they played what has
come to be called the water music.

41
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.090
In fact, they played this hour
long outdoor concert three times,

42
00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.950
twice going upstream,
when your screen going right to left, and

43
00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.560
then once coming back downstream.

44
00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.020
Well, what's this water music?

45
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.650
It's a rather loose connection of
pieces arranged in three groups,

46
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.960
each called a dance suite.

47
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:25.810
What's a dance suite?

48
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.150
Well a suite is just a succession
of pieces in a logical order.

49
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.710
So we have a succession
of short dances here.

50
00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:39.250
Usually dances called Sarabande, or
Minuet, or Ragaudon, or Country Dances.

51
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.050
Things of that sort.

52
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.170
But obviously, on the water,
these pieces couldn't be danced.

53
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.648
They were just listened to.

54
00:03:46.648 --> 00:03:50.990
Dance music,
as was often the case in the baroque and

55
00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:56.620
classical eras, dance music was becoming,
becoming just listening music.

56
00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.490
Called a dance suite,
but just listened to.

57
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.780
Let's give a listen to
just one of these dances.

58
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.340
And to do so, we'll turn to a YouTube clip
coming from a concert given recently at

59
00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:17.600
the famous Prom concerts in the summer in
London at the cavernous Royal Albert Hall.

60
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.230
What your about to see is a group of
performers who specialize in early music,

61
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.310
including baroque music.

62
00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.870
We'll be listening to
a minuet with it's trio.

63
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.150
The tempo is very fast, maybe too fast.

64
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.741
But we'll see.

65
00:04:32.741 --> 00:04:40.439
[MUSIC]

66
00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:43.642
So starting with the natural horn,
so you see no valves here.

67
00:04:43.642 --> 00:04:47.312
[MUSIC]

68
00:04:47.312 --> 00:04:52.630
I'm not sure they're playing all the
correct notes, but we'll pass over that.

69
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.120
It's a bit ragged, it seems to me.

70
00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.010
And a very fast tempo.
[MUSIC]

71
00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:05.130
One, two, three, one, two, three,
one, two, one, two, three.

72
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.280
There's the trio a trio we
originally meant just three lines or

73
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.320
three parts of music.

74
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.430
Top middle bottom.

75
00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.908
Trios are different mood
than the surrounding minuet

76
00:05:18.908 --> 00:05:25.248
[MUSIC]

77
00:05:25.248 --> 00:05:31.520
So here comes the minuet back, and now
orchestrated for violins and woodwinds.

78
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.347
Oh, missed a note or two there.

79
00:05:35.347 --> 00:05:39.292
[MUSIC]

80
00:05:39.292 --> 00:05:41.464
Trio comes back in a minor key.

81
00:05:41.464 --> 00:05:45.990
[MUSIC]

82
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.967
Firstly bassoons.

83
00:05:46.967 --> 00:05:56.967
[MUSIC]

84
00:05:59.605 --> 00:06:02.647
And back to the minuet.

85
00:06:02.647 --> 00:06:13.350
[MUSIC]

86
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:15.610
That's a bit of the water music.

87
00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:20.790
Let's go on now to listen to another
piece of royal music, music for

88
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:22.835
the Royal Fireworks.

89
00:06:22.835 --> 00:06:25.270
Handel composed it later in 1749 for

90
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:29.280
an outdoor summer entertainment for
King George II.

91
00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:34.430
Again, a big orchestra by
baroque standards was required.

92
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:39.880
About 50 players so this music could
be heard, would project outdoors.

93
00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:40.929
Here's a slide.

94
00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:46.600
Indeed a colored etching that
shows what these fireworks on

95
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.570
that evening looked like.

96
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.710
They were placed on barges in
the middle of the Thames River,

97
00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:55.210
in front of what was Whitehall,
the center of the government.

98
00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:00.640
The music for the show had been
premiered at a public rehearsal six days

99
00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.218
earlier in the Vauxhall Gardens
on the other side of the river.

100
00:07:04.218 --> 00:07:07.770
More than 12,000 people showed up,

101
00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:13.350
which caused a traffic jam for
three hours over London Bridge.

102
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.930
Then the only bridge as we
saw in a previous slide,

103
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.270
then the only bridge going to
the south side of the Thames.

104
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:24.490
But what this all shows is that
Handel's music was hugely popular for

105
00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:28.400
the rehearsal, there were no fireworks.

106
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.320
The music was the fireworks.

107
00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:36.640
Anyway, let's listen to a bit of the end
of the music for the Royal Fireworks.

108
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.470
A minuet, the final dance.

109
00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:43.590
I really like the performing
group that you're about to hear.

110
00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:45.330
It's a combination of players.

111
00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.639
Combination, we need
a lot of performers here.

112
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.220
A combination of players
from Fribourg Germany.

113
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:55.170
The Fribourg Baroque Ensemble and
actually we heard them earlier when they

114
00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:59.460
played Bach's Brandenburg
concerto number five.

115
00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:02.610
And combined with them
is the English group,

116
00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:06.240
the orchestra of the age of Enlightenment.

117
00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.605
I'll comment as we go.

118
00:08:07.605 --> 00:08:11.669
[MUSIC]

119
00:08:11.669 --> 00:08:17.990
Starting with repertoire of
natural trumpets, no valves.

120
00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:21.483
So here's the minuet.

121
00:08:21.483 --> 00:08:23.839
[MUSIC]

122
00:08:23.839 --> 00:08:27.822
Notice that the tempo,
of course, is much slower.

123
00:08:27.822 --> 00:08:28.982
[MUSIC]

124
00:08:28.982 --> 00:08:31.199
And I would say that
the playing is a lot cleaner.

125
00:08:31.199 --> 00:08:41.199
[MUSIC]

126
00:08:43.497 --> 00:08:47.790
This was a difficult technique,
this clarino playing from the baroque.

127
00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:49.320
Only specialists could do it.

128
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.759
[MUSIC]

129
00:08:51.759 --> 00:08:53.581
Obviously overdid the oboes.

130
00:08:53.581 --> 00:08:55.997
[MUSIC]

131
00:08:55.997 --> 00:08:59.590
See the old in the middle
of the orchestra.

132
00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:01.660
Authentic performance practice.

133
00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.930
What we don't see here is a conductor.

134
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:07.074
The first violinist is conducting,
and that's correct.

135
00:09:07.074 --> 00:09:07.794
[MUSIC]

136
00:09:07.794 --> 00:09:11.092
There were no conductors standing and
waving batons in those days.

137
00:09:11.092 --> 00:09:13.240
So the first violinist is conducting here.

138
00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.098
He's very, very good.

139
00:09:14.098 --> 00:09:17.918
[MUSIC]

140
00:09:17.918 --> 00:09:19.056
The natural horns.

141
00:09:19.056 --> 00:09:29.056
[MUSIC]

142
00:10:06.957 --> 00:10:10.300
>> [APPLAUSE].

143
00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:14.573
>> A wonderful performance of
the minuet at the end of the Music for

144
00:10:14.573 --> 00:10:16.940
the Royal Fireworks.

145
00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:21.640
Now perhaps I'm overdoing this distinction
between Bach the internal looking

146
00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:26.540
perfectionist, and Handel,
the external-looking projectionist.

147
00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.780
Someone who likes to get his music out and
about.

148
00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.730
But there are two moments in looking at

149
00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:34.260
the music of Handel over
the years that have caught my eye.

150
00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.970
One appears in the Messiah,

151
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:42.860
in the famous Hallelujah chorus, where
he's setting up a typical four voice feud,

152
00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:47.450
and we clearly hear the soprano and
the bass enter.

153
00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:49.340
We always do,
because they're the outer parts.

154
00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:52.390
But inner parts are more
difficult to hear.

155
00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:54.090
So what does Handel do?

156
00:10:54.090 --> 00:11:00.320
He combines the tenor and alto into one
voice to make sure that we hear it,

157
00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:05.250
turning this into not a four part fugue,
as it perhaps it should be,

158
00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:07.910
but into a three part fugue.

159
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:11.940
He wants to shine a light on that inner
voice to make sure that we don't miss it.

160
00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:16.090
I don't know of a single
instance where Bach in

161
00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:20.970
a fugue sacrificed ideal purity for
audibility.

162
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:22.530
So to speak.

163
00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:25.740
There's another tell tale moment.

164
00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:30.680
It occurs in the fugue of Handel that we
were listening to earlier in our quiz.

165
00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:32.888
Let me show the music again.

166
00:11:32.888 --> 00:11:38.030
This is a four part fugue, but
every time a voice enters,

167
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:43.060
Handle doubles it with another voice.

168
00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:45.610
Again, to make sure that you hear it.

169
00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:49.310
He doubles the alto,
which is the real entering voice we

170
00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:52.030
see with the blue line there,
he doubles that with the soprano.

171
00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:58.135
And then when the tenor comes in, he's
doubling that with, with the bass line.

172
00:11:58.135 --> 00:11:59.955
Bach would not have,

173
00:11:59.955 --> 00:12:03.930
Bach would not have doubled,
as we'll see on this next screen here.

174
00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:07.610
Bach wouldn't have doubled that
alto line with the soprano.

175
00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:10.600
He would have had the alto
start by itself, and

176
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.720
then it would have been picked
up by the soprano later.

177
00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:18.150
Similarly he would not have doubled
the tenor line with the base line.

178
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:22.710
It's a small point, small point,
but I think it's an important one.

179
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:28.460
To summarize, maybe even to exaggerate,
the difference between Bach and Hendel.

180
00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.290
Bach was an idealist.

181
00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:32.110
Handel was a realist.

182
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:36.203
Handel really wanted to make
sure that you heard his music.
