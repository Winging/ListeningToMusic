2
00:00:08.587 --> 00:00:10.850
Now we come to Handel and opera.

3
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.670
As we said, Handel first came to London
in 1710 to make money composing and

4
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.200
producing opera.

5
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.870
The kind of opera,
then really the only kind of opera that

6
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.090
dominated the stage of Europe at
this time, called opera seria.

7
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.160
Opera seria literally,
serious opera, was just that.

8
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.000
It was very serious.

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.740
Having as a plot contained
in the libretto.

10
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.220
A story of Greek or
Roman kings and queens, or

11
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.860
gods or goddesses, or
larger than life heroes from antiquity.

12
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.730
In other words,
it was high end subject matter, and

13
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.500
that's what the nobility, or the upper
crust of the day, liked to see on stage.

14
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.240
Mirror images of themselves.

15
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.410
And of course because opera had started
in Italy all opera seria was composed

16
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.270
to a libretto written in Italian.

17
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.460
A literary person wrote the story,
the libretto and

18
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.370
then a musician,
the composer set it to music.

19
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.140
Wrote the score.

20
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.310
Opera seria was usually in three acts, and

21
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.350
it was long, usually about three hours,
including intermissions.

22
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.420
Handel's first opera seria for
London was Rinaldo of 1711,

23
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.950
about the loves of a mythical
classical figure of that name.

24
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.290
It was first performed in a London
theater with a long history.

25
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.490
The theater was first built in 1705
in the Haymarket section of London.

26
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.440
It was called the Queen's Theatre
because a Queen then reigned.

27
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.470
Then with the advent of George I, Hendel's
boss, it was called the King's Theatre.

28
00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.750
And now it's called Her Majesty's Theatre.

29
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.180
Here we see various views of this
venerable theater over the centuries.

30
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.620
From Handel's Day in the upper left,

31
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:09.010
to a performance in the 19th century in
the bottom left, to how it looks today.

32
00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:11.030
The shell never really changed but

33
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.930
the inside and
outside were continually refurbished.

34
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.610
And by coincidence it was here that

35
00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.844
Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom of
the Opera was premiered in 1986.

36
00:02:22.844 --> 00:02:29.260
Which went on to become of course
the most popular of all musicals.

37
00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.420
More than 130 million
people have seen it live.

38
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.820
So From Handel's Rinaldo,
to Phantom of the Opera.

39
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.620
Anyway, like all baroque opera seria,

40
00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.270
Rinaldo was made up of a succession
of recitatives and arias.

41
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:52.170
And among the arias, the most famous
has proved to be one sung by Rinaldo.

42
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.330
Lascia chi'o pianga.

43
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.570
Let me weep in my cruel faith.

44
00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.640
Let's have a listen to it.

45
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.860
But a word before we do.

46
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.680
As mentioned before baroque opera is for
the high born.

47
00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.340
The nobility.

48
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.330
And to be high born in a baroque
opera you had to have a high voice.

49
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.860
Whether male or female.

50
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.210
The hero or
the heroine had to have a high voice.

51
00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.200
Either a soprano or a castrato.

52
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.060
The tenor, the high natural male voice,
the tenor hero really

53
00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.079
didn't step on to the operatic stage until
later, not really until the 19th century.

54
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.930
So in Handel's Rinaldo, the role of
Rinaldo was sung by a castrato, but

55
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.170
because castratos are in
short supply these days,

56
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.450
indeed non-existent, Rinaldo was
usually sung by a male falsettist.

57
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.690
And that's what we're going to hear here.

58
00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.100
In fact we're going to hear and

59
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.590
extraordinary falsettist,
the Frenchman Philippe Jaroussky.

60
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.530
When I first heard this voice,
I couldn't believe it.

61
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.250
It had a purity, a clarity, and

62
00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.610
an accuracy of pitch that I thought
were astonishing, at least to me.

63
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.500
As one opera critic has said Jaroussky
has the sound of an angel, but

64
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.420
the technique,
the technical accuracy of the devil.

65
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.507
Let's give a listen to
this very special voice,

66
00:04:15.507 --> 00:04:18.379
the French falsettist Philippe Jaroussky.

freedom.

[MUSIC]

72
00:05:07.338 --> 00:05:15.212
[INAUDIBLE]
a very slow triple meter.

73
00:05:15.212 --> 00:05:18.086
Coming back to the opening phrase.

74
00:05:18.086 --> 00:05:24.129
[MUSIC]

75
00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:25.462

[MUSIC]

79
00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:43.324
Now in this period, in the Baroque period,

80
00:05:43.324 --> 00:05:48.340
composers tended to write arias
in something called da capo form.

81
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.480
Well, da capo simply means
take it from the head.

82
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.990
So what you would have is
a piece in two sections.

83
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.420
An A section.

84
00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:00.270
Then a B section in which the key changed,

85
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.530
here we'll see it change to minor and
the mood changed.

86
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:08.330
So we have an A section, a B section,
then the composer would simply write in da

87
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.600
capo take it from the top, and you'd
go all the way back to the beginning.

88
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:18.000
Now that seems to be anti dramatic, it
seems the stopper slowed down the drummer.

89
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.900
But it does give the soloist a chance
to reprise a lovely melody and

90
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.990
to add some vocal ornamentation
which was part and

91
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.730
parcel of the Baroque
process in this period.

92
00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:34.463
So let's go on now, we're just going
to continue with the B section.

93
00:06:34.463 --> 00:06:39.379
Shifting to minor the B
section of this da capo aria.

94
00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:49.379
[MUSIC]

95
00:07:03.212 --> 00:07:05.336

00:07:05.336 --> 00:07:11.380
[FOREIGN]
>> Tempo increases, gets faster.

97
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:12.815

>> [FOREIGN]
>> Something

99
00:07:19.545 --> 00:07:25.546
about my internal conflict rages and
in my suffering I pray for mercy.

101
00:07:33.963 --> 00:07:35.810
>> There's the word pieta, mercy.

102
00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.790
And back to the A section.

103
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:42.120
We've gone back to the head.

104
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:52.921
And you can hear the singer begin
to introduce ornamentation.

105
00:07:52.921 --> 00:08:02.921
>> [MUSIC]

106
00:08:28.922 --> 00:08:33.206

>> [MUSIC]

110
00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:55.381
>> So what did you think

111
00:08:55.381 --> 00:08:59.920
of that voice,

112
00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:07.610
that falsetto's voice?

113
00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:10.320
I find it captivating,
but not everyone does.

114
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.680
What do you think?

115
00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.410
Send me an email.

116
00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:14.410
But like that voice or

117
00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:19.580
not, that's what the audience of Handel's
day paid its money for, paid to hear.

118
00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:22.880
Beautiful music and a high male voice.

119
00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:30.585
So this singing by Philippe Jaroussky was
a modern rendition of an opera by Handel.

120
00:09:30.585 --> 00:09:34.860
But, let's use a bit of imagination to
pretend we're back in Handel's day,

121
00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:38.380
listening to a production of
Rinaldo in the Queen's Theatre.

122
00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:42.420
A few years back,
a movie called Farinelli,

123
00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:46.260
did just that, tried to give us
a sense of what opera was like

124
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:50.250
when the castrato reigned
supreme back in Handel's day.

125
00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:55.680
They created an imaginary stage and
an imaginary voice,

126
00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.950
an imaginary castrato voice.

127
00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:03.620
They actually synthesized electronically
the voice of a female soprano and a male

128
00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:08.430
falsettist to come up with something
approximating a baroque castrato voice.

129
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:18.312
Let's watch a scene of this cinematic
creation of Handel's Let Me Languish.

130
00:10:18.312 --> 00:10:24.150
>> [FOREIGN]
>> So here we are in the B section

131
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:29.410
of this da capo aria,
the same aria that we just heard.

132
00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:30.990
You can hear the pitch is higher.

133
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:33.733
>> [FOREIGN]

134
00:10:33.733 --> 00:10:39.851
>> Now the bass will

135
00:10:39.851 --> 00:10:44.658
slide down,

136
00:10:44.658 --> 00:10:52.966
back to the A section.

137
00:10:52.966 --> 00:10:58.817
>> [FOREIGN]
>> Imitation.

138
00:10:58.817 --> 00:11:01.504
He, of course, is lip syncing but
it's still a lovely sound.

139
00:11:01.504 --> 00:11:11.504
>> [MUSIC]

140
00:11:50.171 --> 00:11:54.695
>> Okay, so get ready now as he
begins to fold some notes and

141
00:11:54.695 --> 00:11:58.020
pushes for extreme amount of time.

142
00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:04.208
>> [FOREIGN]
>> Or perhaps

143
00:12:04.208 --> 00:12:10.420
a bit over the top.

144
00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:13.510
But there is much truth to this scene.

145
00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:19.880
The castratis were renowned for
their capacity for long held pitches.

146
00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:23.600
Maybe because of their bigger frame, or
the fact that they were using chest voice.

147
00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.000
I'm really not sure.

148
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.070
But this ability to extend
the duration of the pitches

149
00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:32.430
was part of the wow
factor of the castrato.

150
00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:38.820
Anyway, with his opera,
Rinaldo, Handel had a hit and

151
00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.220
gradually got more adventuresome.

152
00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:46.840
Producing not just one occasional
opera but an entire season of opera,

153
00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:50.960
and he did so
by means of a grand commercial scheme.

154
00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:56.350
He set up what we in the U.S.
would call a private equity.

155
00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:59.090
A privately held stock company.

156
00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:03.130
Wealthy, knowledgeable individuals with
an appreciation of art were invited to

157
00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:07.640
contribute money to buy a share of the
company, in this case an opera company.

158
00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:12.800
And thereby, pay for
a series of operas each year.

159
00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.000
The venture was called
the Royal Academy of Music.

160
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.640
It wasn't so much an academy
in the sense it was a school.

161
00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:23.600
But it was royal in the sense that
the king and queen were investors.

162
00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.610
Partners bought shares of the company and

163
00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:31.150
they shared in the profits or
the losses each year.

164
00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:34.160
This was capitalism in
early 18th century London,

165
00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.290
where capitalism in the west
really got its start.

166
00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:41.432
Well, Handel ran this opera company.

167
00:13:41.432 --> 00:13:45.340
He chose the theater,
he chose the singers,

168
00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:49.310
he set the pay scale for all
the employees, he composed the music, and

169
00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:52.470
he rehearsed and
conducted all the performances.

170
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:58.630
Sometimes he enjoyed great artistic and
financial success and sometimes he didn't.

171
00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:04.800
His most successful opera was Julius
Caesar of 1724 based on an episode in

172
00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:11.590
the life of Caesar in which he pursues and
defeats his rival Pompey in Egypt,

173
00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:16.690
but Queen Cleopatra,
in turn, conquers Caesar.

174
00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:18.408
Or at least the heart of Caesar.

175
00:14:18.408 --> 00:14:22.230
Through her beauty and through her music.

176
00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:25.805
Let's hear a bit of
the central aria V'adoro,

177
00:14:25.805 --> 00:14:31.800
Vadoro Pupille during
which Cleopatra attempts

178
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:37.490
to capture the heart to seduce Caesar
again through the beauty of the music.

179
00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:40.560
We'll hear only a bit of V'adoro Pupille.

180
00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:46.972
We'll pick it up with the return

181
00:14:46.972 --> 00:14:54.106
to the A section of our da capo form.

182
00:14:54.106 --> 00:15:00.461
>> [FOREIGN]
>> So

183
00:15:00.461 --> 00:15:05.607
because we are back in the A section,

184
00:15:05.607 --> 00:15:08.429
we are, of course,

185
00:15:08.429 --> 00:15:14.240
hearing the great beautiful [INAUDIBLE].

186
00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:17.445
>> [FOREIGN]
>> And to make this music even more

187
00:15:17.445 --> 00:15:24.710
beautiful, Handel has required that two
orchestras accompany the singer here.

188
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:30.540
One is on stage, and one is in the pit.

189
00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:32.284
>> [FOREIGN]
>> And as you can see,

190
00:15:32.284 --> 00:15:37.608
Cleopatra is doing everything possible,
physically and

191
00:15:37.608 --> 00:15:42.504
vocally to seduce Caesar,
who rests upon the stage.

192
00:15:42.504 --> 00:15:52.504
>> [FOREIGN]

193
00:17:25.045 --> 00:17:29.065
>> Well, Handel intended to write
in his opera, the most sensual,

194
00:17:29.065 --> 00:17:34.850
maybe the most sensational music possible
so as to attract and hold an audience.

195
00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:40.900
But as beautiful as Handel's music often
was, and we heard beautiful music here.

196
00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:43.670
It sometimes wasn't enough
to hold his audience.

197
00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:49.640
And this kind of opera was
hugely expensive to produce.

198
00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:54.550
The annual salary of the leading
castrato would have been about $500,000,

199
00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:57.100
roughly, in the money of today.

200
00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:00.140
And this was just one singer in the cast.

201
00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:06.990
Anyway, in most years Handel's opera
company actually lost money, and

202
00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:12.770
in 1729 it went bankrupt, a victim of
high expenses and changing fashions.

203
00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:17.335
Handel and the listening public
gradually turned away from opera and

204
00:18:17.335 --> 00:18:19.740
to a more middle class.

205
00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:22.780
A more populus genre of music, oratorio.

206
00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:26.879
And that's where we too now turn.
