2
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.430
Today we think of Handel, mostly, as
a composer, not of opera, but of oratorio.

3
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.630
Indeed what we think of as oratorio

4
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.050
was created almost single handedly
by George Frideric Handel.

5
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.100
But first of all where do
we get the term moratorium.

6
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.320
Well the word comes again
from Italian oratorio

7
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.870
which was a building for Christian prayer
and singing that seems to have gotten

8
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.220
started in Rome in the 1616, and
here we have a surviving example in Rome.

9
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.230
In oratorios, these places of singing and

10
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.890
praying, in oratorios such as this,
religious music was sung,

11
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.730
and Handel of course knew about it
because he lived in Rome for three years.

12
00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.800
So when opera became more and
more unprofitable for Handel in London,

13
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.750
he started to write more and
more oratorios.

14
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.870
Not oratorios for worship but oratorios
for the theater, oratorios for money.

15
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:17.900
More Londoners would pay to hear oratorio
in theater than would pay to hear opera.

16
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.510
Indeed, opera and oratorio as conceived
by Handel had many similarities.

17
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.460
They were performed in a theater
before a paying audience.

18
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.490
They began with an overture,
were divided into three acts and

19
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.250
consisted mostly of recitatives and
arias; but there were differences.

20
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.419
First of all,
Handel's oratorios are in English.

21
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.590
Although done in a theater they don't
use scenery and costumes or acting.

22
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.320
The listener has to imagine
the drama in his or her minds eye.

23
00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.000
Third, the plots are about events written
in scripture from the new testament but

24
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.430
most often from the old testament.

25
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.650
Fourth, voices tend to be less operatic,
less virtuosic, and

26
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.310
more along the lines of
good church singer voices.

27
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.470
And five, the populace in
the form of the chorus on stage,

28
00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.799
does a lot of moralizing,
talks about what's going on in the story.

29
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.440
And thus the chorus plays a larger
role in Handel's oratorials.

30
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.210
Indeed, writing choruses was,
as they say, Handel's sweet spot,

31
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.390
his real strength writing these
choruses in his oratorios.

32
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.430
And sixth, and finally, oratorios appealed
to the increasingly numerous middle class.

33
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.640
Of course Handel's oratorio
Messiah is best known.

34
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.420
It was written in Dublin, Ireland.

35
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.586
Why Dublin, Ireland?

36
00:02:55.586 --> 00:03:00.105
Well, in 1741,
Handel had the opportunity to write and

37
00:03:00.105 --> 00:03:05.254
perform and entire season of
music 1741 and 1742 in Dublin.

38
00:03:05.254 --> 00:03:10.246
So he rounded up some music and
he rounded up some instruments and

39
00:03:10.246 --> 00:03:15.340
wrote some music, new and specific for
Dublin and off he sailed.

40
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.169
Actually he wrote Messiah
remarkably quickly in just three

41
00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:22.879
weeks in September of 1741.

42
00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:28.078
But the work wasn't performed
until April of 1742 because Handel

43
00:03:28.078 --> 00:03:32.923
was waiting for the solemn week
of Holy Week right before Easter,

44
00:03:32.923 --> 00:03:38.895
which he thought was an appropriate
time of year to perform Messiah.

45
00:03:38.895 --> 00:03:42.980
Nowadays, we usually perform
Messiah right before Christmas.

46
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.565
After the Dublin performance in a theater,
Handel brought Messiah back to London,

47
00:03:49.565 --> 00:03:54.160
re-orchestrated it, adding oboes and
bassoons and horns, and

48
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.350
performed it at a local orphanage for
charity.

49
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.690
The Foundling Hospital, and
actually parts of it are still there.

50
00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.290
The playing fields of Coram and
the primary school are still there,

51
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.370
not far from Russell Square.

52
00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:16.190
So here you see, the grounds of the
orphanage as it looked in the 18th century

53
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:22.770
to which Handel transferred Messiah, as
a way of raising money for this orphanage.

54
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.140
And here's the chapel, where Messiah
was first performed outside of Dublin.

55
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.370
First performed and here's the organ case,

56
00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.610
for the organ that Handel himself paid for
at the end of his life.

57
00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.140
So here for the first time,
again for charity,

58
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:43.500
Messiah was performed not in a theater,
but in a religious context.

59
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.545
Now rehearsals for these performances of
Messiah took place in Handel's house.

60
00:04:49.545 --> 00:04:51.325
It doesn't look very large, but

61
00:04:51.325 --> 00:04:55.087
it was a large house according to
the standards of the 18th century.

62
00:04:55.087 --> 00:04:59.598
And it was located on a square in the most

63
00:04:59.598 --> 00:05:05.220
prestigious section of
18th century London.

64
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.880
When Handel rehearsed Messiah, he did so
here, in his living room in effect.

65
00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.120
Into this room,

66
00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.450
numerous performers crammed to rehearse
the solo parts of the oratorio.

67
00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.910
Now, the most memorable part of Messiah,
of course, is the Hallelujah Chorus,

68
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.140
which ends Part II of of the drama.

69
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.250
Messiah is in three parts, or three acts.

70
00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.800
Part one the prophecy of Christ coming.

71
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.910
Part two, his passion and resurrection.

72
00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:42.470
In part three,
reflections on Christian redemption.

73
00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.790
So, it's part two it ends
with the Hallelujah chorus.

74
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.410
It celebrates Christ's
triumphant resurrection.

75
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.900
As you can see,
starting at the upper left corner there,

76
00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.220
the artograph calls for two trumpets,
and on the second line,

77
00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.120
two timpani,
which is actually quite unusual because.

78
00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.360
Normally in a score of the mid
to late eighteenth century,

79
00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.230
the timpani parts aren't written.

80
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.700
It's up to the drummer,
the drummer is more or

81
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:16.180
less free to fill in whatever
timpani sounds he wishes.

82
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:21.080
So we have to the two trumpets, and then
the timpani, and then the first violins.

83
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.790
Then the second violin's line.

84
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.100
And then the violas, their line.

85
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.570
And then the voices, the four vocal parts.

86
00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:31.790
And then finally down at the bottom,
the bass part for the bass and

87
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.010
the basso continuo.

88
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.440
As you may remember when we studied
musical texture at the beginning of

89
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.370
our course.

90
00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.660
We listen to the hallelujah
chorus as an object lesson,

91
00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.620
demonstrating how a composer,
skilled composer, such as Handel,

92
00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:51.710
can shuffle between monophonic,
homophonic and polyphonic texture.

93
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:57.730
Let me play just a bit of the beginning of
the Hallelujah chorus, but making a point.

94
00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.950
That in Handel's day,
at least initially, in the 1740s,

95
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:06.720
the chorus and the orchestra was
very small by our standards.

96
00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:12.789
Specifically in Dublin,
there was a chorus of 23 singers and

97
00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:16.461
choir boys singing the soprano part.

98
00:07:16.461 --> 00:07:20.511
Here's an example of that small but

99
00:07:20.511 --> 00:07:25.378
very authentic sound from Handel's day.

100
00:07:25.378 --> 00:07:35.046
[MUSIC]

101
00:07:35.046 --> 00:07:37.254
A relatively small orchestra

102
00:07:37.254 --> 00:07:39.962
[MUSIC]

103
00:07:39.962 --> 00:07:42.962
Of about 20 harpsichord in the middle.

104
00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:50.796
[MUSIC]

105
00:07:50.796 --> 00:07:56.019
Chorus also of about 25, with choir boys

106
00:07:56.019 --> 00:08:00.672
as you see singing that soprano part.

107
00:08:00.672 --> 00:08:08.379
[MUSIC]

108
00:08:08.379 --> 00:08:13.710
Handel died in 1759,
nine years after Bach.

109
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:17.820
And contrary to Bach,
who initially fell into obscurity,

110
00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.920
Handel's posthumous reputation only grew.

111
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:27.160
By the 1750s, there were 50 to 60
singers at a performance of Messiah.

112
00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.220
And then, more and
more singers were added.

113
00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:35.070
By 1785,
it was not unknown to have 500 singing.

114
00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:40.580
And, by the mid 1800s, in the low

115
00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:45.890
thousands, Handel Festivals of the People,
as they were called.

116
00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:53.150
Performances of Handel's oratorios became
something akin to arena oratories.

117
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:58.590
Here you see an engraving showing one
such performance at the Chrystal Palace

118
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:03.610
in 1857, with thousands of
volunteers in the chorus.

119
00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:06.910
And this tradition of
everyone singing the Messiah,

120
00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:11.200
Messiah singalongs endures
down to the present day.

121
00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:17.600
So let's end our visit with Handel and
the baroque by

122
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:22.430
hearing not the Hallelujah chorus, we've
heard that earlier in our course, but

123
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:27.390
the end of the chorus that ends
the Messiah, that ends part three.

124
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:32.430
It ends with a giant fugue and
that's appropriate for Baroque music.

125
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:36.400
And it ends on the Hebrew word, amen.

126
00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.590
So be it.

127
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:38.600
I'll comment as we go.

128
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:48.100
So, our fugue starts with the bass'
doubled with the double bass' and cellos.

129
00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:52.171
And as the camera pans to the left,

130
00:09:52.171 --> 00:09:53.379
[MUSIC]

131
00:09:53.379 --> 00:09:54.879
The tenors have come in.

132
00:09:54.879 --> 00:09:58.712
[MUSIC]

133
00:09:58.712 --> 00:10:00.610
So you can see it's a large chorus.

134
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:04.254
Here come the altos.

135
00:10:04.254 --> 00:10:14.213
[MUSIC]

136
00:10:14.213 --> 00:10:16.913
And finally, the sopranos,

137
00:10:16.913 --> 00:10:22.970
giving us the four voices of our
typical four voice fugue texture.

138
00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:28.587
Now the first violins pick
up that same fugue subject.

139
00:10:28.587 --> 00:10:35.379
[MUSIC]

140
00:10:35.379 --> 00:10:37.253
Now, the second violins pick it up.

141
00:10:37.253 --> 00:10:46.254
[MUSIC]

142
00:10:46.254 --> 00:10:49.907
Now, a moment of homophony,
everybody singing together,

143
00:10:49.907 --> 00:10:51.921
so the fugue has been broken off.

144
00:10:51.921 --> 00:11:00.337
[MUSIC]

145
00:11:00.337 --> 00:11:02.350
More homophony.

146
00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:05.550
Now this is a very large group, and
you can see there in the continual,

147
00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:10.150
we have a small Harpsichord, let it
point in fact the members here are so

148
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:15.070
great no body could really hear
those continuo instruments.

149
00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:21.570
This is the larger, more modern approach
to a performance of Handel's Messiah.

150
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:26.546
The conductor here is Neville Marriner

151
00:11:26.546 --> 00:11:28.128
[MUSIC]

152
00:11:28.128 --> 00:11:29.337

154
00:11:33.212 --> 00:11:36.363
>> And here we have polyphonic texture,

155
00:11:36.363 --> 00:11:40.504
in effect the equivalent
of an episode in a fugue.

156
00:11:40.504 --> 00:11:50.504
[MUSIC]

157
00:11:53.629 --> 00:11:58.602
All polyphonic, but
playing motives from the theme,

158
00:11:58.602 --> 00:12:01.421
rather than the theme itself.

159
00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:06.004
[MUSIC]

160
00:12:06.004 --> 00:12:08.050
Melodic sequences rising up.

161
00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:11.600
Very much a modern performing group.

162
00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.480
Notice the hand position on the bow there.

163
00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.100
That's a modern 19th century style.

164
00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:18.520
Okay timpani.

165
00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.504
Trumpet.
A modern valve trumpet.

[MUSIC]

167
00:12:26.963 --> 00:12:30.040
Building up to a huge climax.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.890
We have two timpanis here.

169
00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:34.330
The one on the left plays
the dominant pitch.

170
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:39.285
The one on the right timpanic and
as we drive to the climax here,

171
00:12:39.285 --> 00:12:40.065
there's the dominant.

172
00:12:40.065 --> 00:12:44.296
Notice this huge silence,
thundering silence.

173
00:12:44.296 --> 00:12:54.296
