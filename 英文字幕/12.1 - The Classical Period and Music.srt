[MUSIC]

2
00:00:12.296 --> 00:00:17.403
Have you ever noticed that when you turn
on your TV or watch an ad on the Internet,

3
00:00:17.403 --> 00:00:21.368
or open a newspaper that you see such and
such a watch or such and

4
00:00:21.368 --> 00:00:27.340
such an automobil, even a fancy villa,
advertised as having classical style?

5
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.550
What's that mean, it's a classic?

6
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.320
Well, maybe that that object
is a high end product.

7
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.172
That it has a sense of balance and
proportion, of purity.

8
00:00:37.172 --> 00:00:41.570
Maybe a lack of clutter and
excessive detail that has caused it to

9
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.836
be appreciated over a very
long period of time.

10
00:00:44.836 --> 00:00:47.128
Timeless beauty.

11
00:00:47.128 --> 00:00:52.505
And this is true of high end western art
music, what we call classical music,

12
00:00:52.505 --> 00:00:56.740
as opposed to the generally
beloved popular music.

13
00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:03.180
Classical music, be it Josquin des Prez or
Bach or Mozart, even Wagner, or

14
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.870
Beethoven, Stravinsky, this is all thought
of as classical music with a lowercase c,

15
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.558
music that has been written down and
preserved for us over time.

16
00:01:12.558 --> 00:01:14.260
Music that can be studied.

17
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:22.129
This broad general use of the term
classical, has this lower case c.

18
00:01:22.129 --> 00:01:26.737
This term classical music was
first used in Germany in 1836,

19
00:01:26.737 --> 00:01:31.300
and it first applied to the music
from Bach to Beethoven.

20
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.030
But gradually it got extended to mean

21
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.940
all notated art music from roughly
the year 1000 up to the present day.

22
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.180
Classical music with an uppercase
C subsequently came to mean more

23
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.120
specifically the music from
the 1750 to roughly 1820.

24
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.630
Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven,
and early Schubert.

25
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.960
So Classical music, with an upper-case C,

26
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.260
is a subset of classical music,
music with a certain style.

27
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.830
The style of Mozart, for example.

28
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.870
But what does it sound like?

29
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:14.070
Can you picture in your mind's ear,
the sound of Mozart?

30
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.400
Can you bring to mind the sound of Mozart?

31
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.930
Do you recognize Mozart
in the classical style?

32
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.940
Well let's find out.

33
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.240
Which is Mozart?

34
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.900
Let me play three pieces.

35
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.030
One of which is in
the classical style by Mozart.

36
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.530
Which is the one by Mozart?

37
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.630
Is it A, B, or C?

38
00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:44.630
[MUSIC]

39
00:02:54.336 --> 00:02:59.588
Okay, well, that's an introduction to A,
let's go on now to hear Piece B.

40
00:02:59.588 --> 00:03:01.337
Is this Mr. Mozart?

41
00:03:01.337 --> 00:03:11.337
[MUSIC]

42
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.712
Well, how about now this one,
Piece C, is this Mozart?

43
00:03:31.712 --> 00:03:41.712
[MUSIC]

44
00:03:48.546 --> 00:03:51.545
Okay, let's pause it there.

45
00:03:51.545 --> 00:03:52.753
Well it's not A.

46
00:03:52.753 --> 00:03:58.712
It chugs along with a kind of relentless
rhythm and the melody is one long stream.

47
00:03:58.712 --> 00:04:00.879
This is music by Bach.

48
00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:02.754
And it's not B.

49
00:04:02.754 --> 00:04:04.754
The sound is way too big here.

50
00:04:04.754 --> 00:04:08.290
There are large number
of brass instruments.

51
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.700
Trumpets at the end we heard,
trombones and horns earlier.

52
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.950
This means it's from the 19th century or
later.

53
00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.280
This selection is by Richard Wagner.

54
00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.360
So the correct answer is,
as you may have guessed, C.

55
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.050
Only violins are sounding,
the texture is very light,

56
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:33.310
no brass at all, the structure
melodically is very symmetrical.

57
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.750
Balanced phrasing here.

58
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.880
Well you've likely heard
enough of Mozart beforehand,

59
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.660
to know that C is indeed
the correct answer.

60
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.170
So you know already a bit about
Classical music with a capital C.

61
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.480
But what about architecture, which is the
building here from the Classical period,

62
00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.490
1750 to 1820?

63
00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.590
The one from the classical
period is the one to the left.

64
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.930
Even though, again,
we see the columns, the capitals,

65
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.990
the triangular pediment in the rotunda and
the classical windows.

66
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.990
The image to the right is
the original from Roman antiquity.

67
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.710
It's the famous Pantheon,
in Rome, of course.

68
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:19.950
The one to the left, again,

69
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.230
is Thomas Jefferson's library
at the University of Virginia.

70
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.190
The classical model is drawn upon here.

71
00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:29.900
But they're both classics.

72
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.810
All right,
let's go now to Vienna, Austria.

73
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.830
Here's the Emperor's dancing hall
in Vienna where Mozart and his wife

74
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.290
danced and for which Mozart, Hayden,
Beethoven, they all wrote dance music.

75
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.140
Notice the windows here.

76
00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.700
This is something that interests me,

77
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.280
windows from the classical
period 18th century.

78
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:56.370
Five panes of glass across, with a semi
circular lunette, divided light.

79
00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:01.670
Now let's go to the concert
hall of my own Yale University.

80
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.790
Notice the windows here
are exactly the same.

81
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.370
And indeed, if I took a picture,
I might have done so

82
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:12.720
of a window in my own living room, I'd get
the same type of design, a classic design.

83
00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:19.320
To make this point In another way,
let's look at this very classical building

84
00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:24.770
constructed in the heart of Paris in the
18th century with its classical features,

85
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.060
and sense how wide-spread it became
in the United States in the 19th and

86
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:37.250
20th centuries as the US Capital and
one state capital after another was built.

87
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.280
So the classical era looks
rather conservative and

88
00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.550
rather conventional, and
a lot of it stays with us today.

89
00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.160
But it wasn't always that way.

90
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.570
There was political change and

91
00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:53.880
political revolution came to France with
the French revolution and to North America

92
00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.380
in the American Revolution,
with the Declaration of Independence.

93
00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:02.240
And there were changes in fashion,
as you can see here on the screen.

94
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.800
The wig and the sword of
the gentleman of around 1750 and

95
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.860
the face paint and the beauty marks,
they all disappear.

96
00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.590
Here's how Handel looked around 1750.

97
00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:19.100
And then Beethoven half a century later,
replaced by a more natural,

98
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.810
less aristocratic look.

99
00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.800
And changes were coming to opera as well.

100
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:32.240
Serious opera, opera seria, was being
infiltrated, if not replaced, by a lighter

101
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:38.290
kind of opera called Opera comique
in France, or Opera buffa in Italy.

102
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.930
It often had just spoken dialogue and

103
00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:46.350
more tuneful melodies, not the lengthy
del capo aureos that we heard before.

104
00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:51.210
And the plots in the librettos
showcased everyday characters,

105
00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:53.520
a man-servant, a butler or a maid.

106
00:07:55.550 --> 00:08:03.004
The slide to the left shows the famous
castrato from the mid 18th century.

107
00:08:03.004 --> 00:08:07.670
And that on the right, a modern
recreation of how the barber Figaro,

108
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:12.420
in Mozart's, The Marriage of Figaro,
is often depicted.

109
00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:19.087
Let's watch a portrayal of Barber Figaro
in a production with subtitles.

110
00:08:19.087 --> 00:08:25.463
[MUSIC]

111
00:08:25.463 --> 00:08:27.962
Okay, if you wanna dance.

112
00:08:27.962 --> 00:08:32.796
Notice he's saying [FOREIGN],
the little count.

113
00:08:32.796 --> 00:08:36.900
What is really said in
the vernacular is you little,

114
00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.712
you can fill in the blank yourself.

115
00:08:39.712 --> 00:08:43.540
It's a very dismissive
attitude toward his lord and

116
00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:46.504
master on the part of Figero the barber.

117
00:08:46.504 --> 00:08:53.421
[MUSIC]

118
00:08:53.421 --> 00:08:55.546
I'll call the tune [FOREIGN].

119
00:08:55.546 --> 00:08:56.546
[MUSIC]

120
00:08:56.546 --> 00:08:59.296
Okay.

121
00:08:59.296 --> 00:09:03.751
He begins to ape, mimic, poke fun at,

122
00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:07.671
the fashions of the aristocracy.

123
00:09:07.671 --> 00:09:17.671
[MUSIC]

124
00:09:18.921 --> 00:09:21.838
La Capriola, Capriola was a dance step.

125
00:09:21.838 --> 00:09:25.379
Actually a dance step of the aristocracy.

126
00:09:25.379 --> 00:09:29.004
And if you wanna dance your step,
I'll call the tune.

127
00:09:29.004 --> 00:09:39.004
[MUSIC]

128
00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:49.379
Okay, maybe we'll pause it right here.

129
00:09:49.379 --> 00:09:51.991
Well that kind of opera, subversive opera,

130
00:09:51.991 --> 00:09:56.190
by Mozart is very different from high
flown Opera seria of the baroque.

131
00:09:56.190 --> 00:10:00.620
The classical period,
while conservative architecturally,

132
00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:03.390
was often revolutionary socially.

133
00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:07.590
And sometimes revolutionary musically.

134
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:11.854
Mozart's opera Figaro was
premiered at a Viennese theatre,

135
00:10:11.854 --> 00:10:14.680
one run by Emperor Joseph II.

136
00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.870
But the Emperor's sister,
Marie Antoinette,

137
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:22.160
Queen of France, literally lost
her head in the French revolution.

138
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:28.070
That was just to begin just three years
after the premiere of Mozart's opera.

139
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:30.711
As you heard, there is tension, and

140
00:10:30.711 --> 00:10:35.837
there is drama in this seemingly
serene music of the classical period.
