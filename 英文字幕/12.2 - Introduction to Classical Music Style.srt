00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.615
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:10.615 --> 00:00:14.490
All right, in our lest segment we
tried to differentiate between

3
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.920
the aristocratic baroque and
the more democratic classical period.

4
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.300
Admittedly all simplified a bit, but
differentiated in terms of architecture

5
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.140
dress and even social relations,
the tension between the aristocracy and

6
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.930
the middle class,
now let's focus on the music.

7
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.530
I'm going to play two pieces.

8
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.300
One of the Baroque era by Bach, and one
from the classical period by Mozart, and

9
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.580
you are going to differentiate
between the two.

10
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.960
We'll start with Bach's Air,
a slow song or

11
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.380
air, coming from a suite of pieces for
Baroque orchestra.

12
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.200
As we listen and

13
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.850
watch, I want you to think about the
characteristics of style in this music.

14
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.960
Let's focus on the first questions.

15
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.940
Okay, list of questions here.

16
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:02.860
What's the texture?

17
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.620
-
Monophonic, homophonic, or polyphonic?

18
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.460
Where's the melody?

19
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.990
What's the bass doing?

20
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.210
What's the pulse of the bass?

21
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.180
What is the mood of the music?

22
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.230
Does the mood change?

23
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.010
We'll watch a musical animation here
by my friend Steve Malanowksy from

24
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.300
Richmond, California.

25
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.680
Here we get both a musical score and
a graphic representation.

26
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.326
Obviously, we have four parts.

27
00:01:31.326 --> 00:01:35.610
[MUSIC]

28
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.110
First violin, second violin,
viola and cello.

29
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.500
Cello double [INAUDIBLE] double basses.

30
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.170
Speaking of the double basses.

31
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.300
Knows what they're doing.

32
00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.970
All the same beat plotting
along in 8th notes here.

33
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.234
Good example of a Baroque walking bass.

34
00:01:55.234 --> 00:01:59.889
There's melody, well it's up above for
the most part but

35
00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:05.409
sometimes the second violin joins
in to produce a composite melody.

36
00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.416
[MUSIC]

37
00:02:09.416 --> 00:02:14.675
Now they double basses work
double time to signify a repeat.

38
00:02:14.675 --> 00:02:24.675
[MUSIC]

39
00:02:26.215 --> 00:02:29.896
Has the mood of the music
changed in any way?

40
00:02:29.896 --> 00:02:32.590
No, I'd say the mood is pretty much
the same from beginning to end.

41
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.670
Okay, let's pause this here.

42
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:42.520
What have we learned?

43
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.670
Well, let's take a look at a slide
that may help us in this regard.

44
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:50.970
What's the texture?

45
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.580
Is it monophonic,
homophobic or polyphonic?

46
00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.220
Well, polyphonic, that's mostly the
composite of four lines going their own

47
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.270
way at one time.

48
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.890
So I'd say mostly polyphonic texture,
whereas the melody.

49
00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.180
Well, the melody is mostly in the first
violin, but sometimes in the second.

50
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.040
What's the bass doing?

51
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:18.250
Well, as we heard, it's moving along,
almost relentlessly in a steady beat.

52
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.760
What's the pulse of that bass?

53
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.470
Well, as we saw, eighth note but
always the same,

54
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.690
a good example of
the baroque walking bass.

55
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.020
And finally whats the mood of the music?

56
00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.130
Well, does the mood change in anyway?

57
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.100
With the mood I would submit
is generally serene relaxed,

58
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.390
i feel secure when I listen to this.

59
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.640
Does it ever change from beginning to
end of this about five minute piece?

60
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.990
No, it has the same ethos
from beginning to end.

61
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.720
So what have we learned here?

62
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.650
Well, we might have learned that
the strings dominate here in the Baroque.

63
00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.920
The melody spins out in these long,
sometimes asymmetrical phrases.

64
00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.030
That late Baroque music is full of
polyphony that has a very strong bass.

65
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.920
It has consistent rhythmic
patterns driving it forward and

66
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.440
a consistent mood or ethos,
ethos from beginning to end.

67
00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.150
Okay, good.

68
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.150
Now, let's take a piece by Mozart.

69
00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.830
Again, we're going to grab only
forty seconds or so here but

70
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.880
that's really all we need, and let's focus
on a few questions that will help us

71
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.620
identify the difference between late
baroque and classical musical style.

72
00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.480
Our choice here is the opening
of Mozart's symphony number 25

73
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.360
written in 1773 when he was 17.

74
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.830
Wait a minute,
[LAUGH] hang on here a minute.

75
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.293
Symphony number 25?

76
00:04:46.293 --> 00:04:48.951
25 symphonies and he's 17?

77
00:04:48.951 --> 00:04:50.135
That's impossible.

78
00:04:50.135 --> 00:04:52.434
No, that's Mozart.

79
00:04:52.434 --> 00:04:56.782
He was a genius, and more than any
other genius, he was a prodigy and

80
00:04:56.782 --> 00:05:00.280
able to do all of this
at a very young age.

81
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.730
Well, let's look now at
our Mozart questions.

82
00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:08.520
How do we recognize a classical
piece by Haydn or Mozart?

83
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.520
What's the texture, monophonic,
homophonic, polyphonic?

84
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.390
Where is the melody?

85
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:14.450
What's the bass doing?

86
00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.330
What's the pulse of the bass?

87
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.920
What's the mood of the music?

88
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.020
Does the mood change?

89
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.500
So let's now go to a, a video again.

90
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.010
This also by Steve Malinowsky.

91
00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.010
It doesn't have a musical score with it,
only the graphics.

92
00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.263
And we may be stopping along the way.

93
00:05:34.263 --> 00:05:41.066
[MUSIC]

94
00:05:41.066 --> 00:05:43.584
Okay, I'm going to stop it right there.

95
00:05:43.584 --> 00:05:45.465
At the outset, we heard.

96
00:05:45.465 --> 00:05:48.972
[MUSIC]

97
00:05:48.972 --> 00:05:50.526
And it sounded like a lot
of people were playing.

98
00:05:50.526 --> 00:05:52.669
Actually, it was just one melody line,

99
00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:55.450
everybody playing what's
called at octaves.

100
00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.410
So this, although it might sound complex,

101
00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:01.620
is actually just a good
example of monophonic texture.

102
00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.670
And then as you see on the screen there,
you have up above a melody.

103
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.470
That's why these animations are useful.

104
00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.100
Now you have up above a melody and
have these green blocks underneath.

105
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.750
Well, the green blocks are chords
that are supporting the melody.

106
00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.970
So we have an example of
homophonic texture here.

107
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:18.650
So let's go back to the beginning.

108
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.830
Let me go back to
the beginning that'd be great.

109
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.900
And we're going to pick
it up with that's fine.

110
00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.604
We'll start right here, and

111
00:06:26.604 --> 00:06:30.229
in a moment up will come the music
with our monophonic texture.

112
00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:40.229
[MUSIC]

113
00:06:41.423 --> 00:06:44.522
Yeah, back to monophonic
they're all together, in chain.

114
00:06:44.522 --> 00:06:47.622
[MUSIC]

115
00:06:47.622 --> 00:06:51.120
Little bit of polyphony here,
a little bit more activity here.

116
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:57.820
Notice here back to homophony but notice
how very soft sweet oboe takes over.

117
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.360
Chord, chord.

118
00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.754
Okay, we are going to stop it right there.

119
00:07:12.754 --> 00:07:17.574
There we go, we are going to pause
it right there, and go back and

120
00:07:17.574 --> 00:07:22.609
ask us, yes, some questions again
about this piece by Mozart.

121
00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:24.337
So let's go to our first slide here and

122
00:07:24.337 --> 00:07:28.430
just removed what's the texture,
monophonic, homophonic, or polyphonic.

123
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.960
Well, let's see what we had in this piece.

124
00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:36.980
Yep, monophonic and, homophonic,
very little polyphonic here.

125
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.050
Where's the melody?

126
00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:41.770
Well, again, it's always on the top,
more so on the top,

127
00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:45.040
it was virtually all on the top,
always in the first violin.

128
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.930
What's the bass doing?

129
00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:50.610
Well, I didn't hear much bass there,
I just heard melody.

130
00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:54.560
Melody is much more important
here in the classical era.

131
00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:58.900
Then, the bass is,
what's the pulse of the bass?

132
00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:02.670
Well, the pulse of the bass,
difficult really to find.

133
00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:06.070
Difficult to identify because
the pulse is in the melody.

134
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:07.810
What's the mood of the music?

135
00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:08.740
Well, it starts out as you heard-

136
00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:12.200
[MUSIC]

137
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.750
All that syncopation is very agitated,
veryanxious, but

138
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:20.444
in the course of just those few seconds,
it changes when the oboe comes to the.

139
00:08:20.444 --> 00:08:26.132
[MUSIC]

140
00:08:26.132 --> 00:08:33.060
The relaxed oboe lines has become very,
very lyrical by that point.

141
00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:38.700
So what do we conclude from this,
by way of classical music?

142
00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.540
How might we recognize
a piece by Hayden or Mozart?

143
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:47.700
Well, listen for
a string dominated style, style.

144
00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:51.830
One in which occasionally
solo woodwinds will pop up.

145
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:57.110
Melody is generally shorter,
often in units of two, or four, or eight.

146
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:59.260
It's symmetrical, it's balanced,

147
00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:03.290
the texture in classical
music is mostly homophonic.

148
00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:06.390
You get a melody plus
chordal accompaniment.

149
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:09.290
And the texture generally is lighter.

150
00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:14.110
The bass is much less obvious
compared to baroque music.

151
00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:18.880
Rhythmic patterns, well, there's more
of a stop and go process at work here.

152
00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.250
I always think of this as something
like the slinky that I had as a kid.

153
00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:26.050
It would race to the next step and then
sit there for awhile and then race, sit

154
00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:30.870
there, so it's much more unpredictable,
the rhythmic patterns in classical music.

155
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:35.630
And as we heard, the mood can change
within the same piece or movement.

156
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.640
There is no constant ethos here.

157
00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.780
You can start in agitated fashion,

158
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:44.330
become very lyrical within
a very short period of time.

159
00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:50.295
Okay, well, that's some music by Mozart.

160
00:09:50.295 --> 00:09:53.269
[INAUDIBLE] And
the composer of this music,

161
00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:57.740
Mozart, was born in Salzburg,
but moved to and died in Vienna.

162
00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:04.542
Haydn was born in Rohrau, Austria,
but moved to and died in Vienna.

163
00:10:04.542 --> 00:10:11.288
Beethoven was born in Bonn, Germany,
but moved to and died in Vienna.

164
00:10:11.288 --> 00:10:15.073
What do we detect from this pattern,
don't go to Vienna?

165
00:10:15.073 --> 00:10:18.416
No, on the contrary,
do very much go to Vienna.

166
00:10:18.416 --> 00:10:24.556
So let's go to

167
00:10:24.556 --> 00:10:30.697
Vienna and see

168
00:10:30.697 --> 00:10:38.890
what's going on.
