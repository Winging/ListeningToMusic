[MUSIC]

2
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.260
What's your favorite city?

3
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.070
New York?

4
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:12.860
Paris?

5
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.460
Las Vegas?

6
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.400
I know New York City, two of my children
live there, and three work there.

7
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.760
I love Paris,
I spent a year there as a student and

8
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.290
it's my favorite city, I think.

9
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.790
Maybe tied for first place in my mind
is Vienna, which I've visited and

10
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.130
done research in on five occasions.

11
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.820
Vienna, more than any city of the world,
is the capital of western classical music.

12
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.380
Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven,
Shubert, Bruckner, Brahms, Wagner,

13
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.830
Mahler, Schoenberg, Richard Strauss,

14
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.560
Johann Strauss, they all lived
there at one time or another.

15
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.820
How did it come to be that
Vienna came to be called, and

16
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.370
still is called the City of Music?

17
00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.480
Well, follow the money.

18
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.780
Follow the excess capital.

19
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.310
In the late 18th century Vienna was
the capital of the Holy Roman Empire.

20
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.210
It was also the last and
the largest city before you

21
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.390
hit a vast agricultural region to
the east, running all the way to Russia.

22
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.130
The fiefs and

23
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.740
the states were run by aristocrats
who came in from the countryside,

24
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.200
in from the cold, during the winter,
where there wasn't much agriculture to do.

25
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.530
For entertainment they
didn't go to the movies or

26
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.540
watch TV, they went to the opera and
the theater, and to the casino.

27
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.210
Yes, there was a casino there,
indeed there were several casinos there.

28
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.050
And they sponsored music and
dancing in their palaces.

29
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:52.230
There were more aristocrats per capita in
Vienna than in any other city in Europe.

30
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.150
What did it look like?

31
00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.600
Well, here's a view of Vienna in
the mid 18th century by Canaletto.

32
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.127
Population of about 200,000.

33
00:02:03.127 --> 00:02:07.498
The fourth largest after London,
Paris, and Naples.

34
00:02:07.498 --> 00:02:14.810
About one in every 175 persons was
an aristocrat, a very high percentage.

35
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.980
And one out of about 200
persons was a music teacher.

36
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.020
A lot of, a lot of aristocrats [LAUGH] and
a lot of music teachers.

37
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.010
Because people wanted to make music in
their homes, and be taught how to do so.

38
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.010
Actually this view of Vienna in the 18th

39
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.240
century is very similar to
the way it still looks today.

40
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.760
On the right you see a Benedictine
monastery there, right corner.

41
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.340
And then in the center slightly to
the left, the Schwarzenberg palace and

42
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.360
the Charles church all
the way to the left.

43
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.310
And in the center distance
the cathedral of Saint Stephens.

44
00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.500
Now here we are right in
front of Saint Stevens.

45
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.250
Actually we're right
behind Saint Stevens and

46
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.180
it was here that Mozart's
funeral was held in 1791.

47
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.290
This engraving dates from 192,
and here we are now

48
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.990
in the center of, I can see lets see
if I can get my pointer to work here.

49
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.060
We're going to move over the center
of the city, there's Saint Stevens.

50
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.560
And here is one of the main
drags here in Vienna,

51
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.750
the Graben and here is
the [INAUDIBLE] going out this way.

52
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.720
Current opera houses over here,
Mozart, he lived,

53
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.370
you can,
let me see if I can pull my cursor back.

54
00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.280
He lived in a house here in
[INAUDIBLE] strasa at one point.

55
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.262
Another house,
apartment over here on the [FOREIGN].

56
00:03:45.262 --> 00:03:46.697
And where else?

57
00:03:46.697 --> 00:03:48.885
So Mozart lived over here for

58
00:03:48.885 --> 00:03:53.270
a time, Haydn lived out in
the suburbs in the 1790s.

59
00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.790
He bought his piano here,
pianos at Kernig showroom here

60
00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.230
in Beethoven lived out here in the
Pasqueladie, house on the ramparts, and

61
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.820
right here in the center, this is
the Hofburg, where the emperor lives.

62
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.670
So let's take a look at that.

63
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.030
Here's the emperor's dwelling,
the Hofburg in the 18th century,

64
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.680
with the troops drilling out there.

65
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.950
And here's how that
same plaza looks today.

66
00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.010
Hofburg, the Imperial Palace
as it is today.

67
00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.780
About a block from there
was the Burgtheater.

68
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.820
Run by the Emperor.

69
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:39.090
And you can see a show going on and many
of Mozart's, operas were premiered here

70
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.830
and many, public concerts
were given in this theatre.

71
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.700
Now, we said that Vienna was the city
of the aristocracy and here is

72
00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:55.370
just one of the houses of the aristocrats,
this is the Auenshammer Palace in Vienna.

73
00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.870
These were patrons of Mozart.

74
00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.890
Here we have an engraving of
the Esterhazy Palace in Vienna.

75
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.540
The Esterhazy were the patrons of Haydn.

76
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.760
Here we have another Canaletto painting,
showing on the left,

77
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.410
the Palace of the Lobkowitz.

78
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.460
And it was here that Beethoven's Eroica
Symphony was premiered in 1803 in

79
00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.950
that house sponsored by the Lobkowitz.

80
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.080
Even today as you walk around Vienna
on a fine summer evening you can

81
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.250
hear the strains of music from public
concerts coming out of those windows.

82
00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.400
All right, let's review here quickly.

83
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.350
Vienna, city of music,
capital of the old holy Roman empire,

84
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.050
fourth largest city in Europe,
the cosmopolitan center,

85
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:49.510
attractive musicians from throughout
Europe, aristocratic patrons, but not only

86
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:55.340
aristocratics attending these concerts,
but public concerts developing as well.

87
00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.590
Both public and
aristocratic concerts in the Burgtheater.

88
00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.960
There were both
aristocratic performers and

89
00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.810
amateur performers and
they all needed musical teachers.

90
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:06.980
And the fact that there were so

91
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:12.610
many aristocrats and so
much money to be spent in Vienna.

92
00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:16.810
This became the center of what we
call the Viennese classical school.

93
00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:21.020
Classical style epitomized in
the music of such composers as Hayden,

94
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.410
Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert.

95
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.640
They created the Viennese classical style.

96
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.840
So that's a brief introduction to Vienna,
city of music.

97
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.966
Let's go on now to meet Haydn and Mozart.
