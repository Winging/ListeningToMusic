[MUSIC]

2
00:00:13.795 --> 00:00:15.690
Well, his first name was Franz.

3
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:16.990
Franz Joseph Haydn.

4
00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.800
But more often in his day.

5
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.310
And even today is referred
to just as Joseph Hayden.

6
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.490
Hayden along with Mozart and
Beethoven and a very young Shubert,

7
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.380
were the main figures as we hit scene
in the Viennese classical school.

8
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.310
The heart of classical with a capital C,
the heart of classical music.

9
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.300
Hayden came from very humble lineage.

10
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.380
Indeed his was something
of a rags to riches story.

11
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.660
His father was a wheel maker
in a farm town south of

12
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.420
Vienna with very little formal
education or musical training.

13
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.320
The Hayden family came from here is Rora.

14
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.760
South, South Eastern Austria, at the tip
of the arrow that you see on the screen.

15
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.790
And here's the house in
Rohrau where he was born.

16
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.860
When he was about six,
the choir master of the cathedral of

17
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.100
Saint Stephen in Vienna was going
around the country recruiting.

18
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.560
Scouting for voices and
he heard young Haydn sing.

19
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.110
And he brought him back to
Vienna to be a choir boy in

20
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.480
the cathedral school and church.

21
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.230
Here's a modern view of that imposing
church, where Haydn stayed until his

22
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.880
voice broke in his late teens, stayed
there about ten years and thereafter.

23
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.940
He earned a living as
a freelance musician.

24
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.070
Violinist, keyboardist,
organist at various churches.

25
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.910
Jack of all musical trades.

26
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.670
And he took music lessons as
well to further learn his craft.

27
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.130
Eventually in 1761, almost 30 he
got a job as the Kapellmeister.

28
00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.830
Director of Music as we have seen before.

29
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.410
Director of Music at the court of
the family of the Esterhazy who were

30
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.310
arguably the most wealthy and most
powerful of all the nobles in Austria,

31
00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.450
save the Austrian royal family,
the Emperor's family itself.

32
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.860
So here's a slide of the Esterhazy Palace.

33
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.560
Very large as you can see and imposing.

34
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.480
Where they stayed during
most of the winter.

35
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.270
This is in downtown Vienna.

36
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.500
But the principle residence
of the Esterhazy was here in

37
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.350
the town of Eisenstadt South of Vienna.

38
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.140
Let's turn to a user
friendly Googlemap here.

39
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.276
So we got Vienna,
we're going south-southeast of Vienna.

40
00:02:42.276 --> 00:02:48.820
And here is the town, city about
35,000 people today of Eisenstadt.

41
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:54.900
And here's how the palace, the Esterházy
Palace looked in the 18th century.

42
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.540
And heres how it looks today,
hasn't changed that much.

43
00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.240
Haydn's house, which he owned in
the 1770's was about a block away.

44
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.740
You can see here his
modest kitchen too and

45
00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.250
Haydn would walk to work to
the entrance of the palace everyday.

46
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.550
And here's that entrance right
there in the lower center and

47
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.000
as we look through it,
think about Haydn walking through there,

48
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.160
we see in the distance the Haydn Cafe,

49
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.530
well actually of course the Haydn Cafe
wasn't there in Haydn's day,

50
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.200
this is just another tourist sham in
a sense of the sort that we saw in

51
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:41.630
Bach's But notice also here in the
Esterhazy Palace the Esterhazy theater.

52
00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.280
You can how big this palace and
how this, big this theater was.

53
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.190
They're very large,
indeed, very magnificent.

54
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.090
But this was not the only
palace the Esterhazy had.

55
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.360
Not just the one in Vienna and
not just the one here in Eisenstadt.

56
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.790
Prince Nikolaus built another
one farther to the south.

57
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.580
So let's take a look
again at our Google map.

58
00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.990
Vienna, Eisenstadt, and
now down to Eszterhazy.

59
00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.790
In the small town, actually it was more or
less in the swamp when

60
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.110
Nikolaus Eszterhazy started to
build this palace called Esterhaza.

61
00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:22.510
And here's how it looked
in the 18th century and

62
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.670
here's how Esterhaza looks today.

63
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.370
Now when Haydn entered the service
of Nicolas Esterhazy in 1761,

64
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:38.210
he was required to sign a contract,
just as Bach had signed a contract.

65
00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.420
By way of an oath to
the town fathers in Leipzig.

66
00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.950
As you'll see when I read this
contract it's very restrictive.

67
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.050
Hayden like every musician of
the day was very much a servant,

68
00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.800
not the grand artiste.

69
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.810
So let me read this contract for us here.

70
00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.320
He and all the musicians
shall appear in uniform, and

71
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.940
the said Joseph Haydn shall
take care that he and

72
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.220
all members of the orchestra follow the
instructions given, and appear in white

73
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.918
stockings, white linen, powdered,
and with either pigtail or tiewig.

74
00:05:15.918 --> 00:05:20.650
He said, Haydn,
shall be under obligation to

75
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.750
compose such music as his Serene Highness
may command, and neither to

76
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:31.900
communicate such compositions to any
other person nor allow them to be copied.

77
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:38.610
But he, the prince, shall retain them for
the absolute use of his Highness, and not

78
00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:45.470
compose for any other person without the
knowledge and permission of his Highness.

79
00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:50.630
Well, the work of art created
by the composer belonged not to

80
00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.300
the composer here as we see,
but to the patron, the prince.

81
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.280
And Haydn was a servant.

82
00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.540
As a matter of fact,

83
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:06.390
there's a portrait of Haydn in the blue
servant's livery of the Esterhazy princes.

84
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:07.710
Let's take a look.

85
00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.630
Here it is,
it's actually owned by my colleague and

86
00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.780
friend, Dan Harts who teaches.

87
00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.490
Now Professor Emeritus at the University
of California at Berkeley.

88
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.230
But that's Hayden in livery's dress.

89
00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:21.600
Now here's Hayden composing.

90
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:28.220
Dressed up here in sort of the business
suit of the day composing at a piano.

91
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.530
You see in his right hand a pen.

92
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.570
With which he wrote down his ideas and

93
00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.460
his left hand which he
tried them out on a piano.

94
00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:44.550
And the piano to the right, as you can see
happens to be one built by Hontang Walter.

95
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.950
And it was used at the Esterházy court,
and

96
00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.750
believed to have been
played on often by Haydn.

97
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.930
I point this out really only to give you
a sense of how small these pianos were

98
00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.280
in Haydn's day,
weighing less than 200 pounds.

99
00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:04.690
Okay, to review here with
our trusty Google map.

100
00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:07.620
The Esterhazy were actually active at

101
00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:13.210
three sites during the nearly 30
years Haydn served Prince Nicolas.

102
00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:19.370
In, first of all, they were active
in Vienna, active in Eisenstadt and

103
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:24.440
active out in the boondocks,
Esterhazy eventually,

104
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:28.430
prince Nicholas died, and
Haydn was given a pension.

105
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.460
And he moved back into Vienna.

106
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:33.480
But very quickly he then set off for

107
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.800
London where he'd been offered a high
paying commission to write a collection of

108
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.220
symphonies, 12 of them,
that were to be performed in London.

109
00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:45.810
And this, he did on and off living
in London between 1791 and 1794.

110
00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:51.200
These were performed in
the Hanover square rooms.

111
00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:58.490
So as you can see by this map the arrow
points to the Hanover square rooms but

112
00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:03.250
if you look just slightly below that
red arrow you see Brook Street and

113
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:04.560
who died on Brooks street?

114
00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.810
None other, then George Frideric Handel.

115
00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:11.510
So there is Handel only about
a block from where Haydn was

116
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:16.170
performing his symphonies in
the Hanover Square Rooms.

117
00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:20.880
And here is how from this
slide those Hanover Square

118
00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:26.460
performing quarters looked
in the 18th century.

119
00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:29.740
This is something of a bellwether,
a mark of the importance of

120
00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:34.460
the growing number of large
concert halls at this time.

121
00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:39.100
And this is how this same hall
looked in the 19th century.

122
00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:45.760
Under normal conditions it would
accommodate about 900 listeners.

123
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:52.090
But for a performance of a Haydn symphony
in 1792, 1,500 were squeezed in.

124
00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:57.550
Well, eventually, Haydn retired and

125
00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:01.410
returned to Vienna to become
the toast of the town.

126
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:04.030
Here, we see a painting of a famous event.

127
00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:09.720
Vienna, 1808 the great hall
of the University of Vienna.

128
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:16.720
Antonio Salieri conducts a performance
of Haydn's Oratorio the Creation.

129
00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:21.040
In honor of the aging Haydn who is
sitting in a special chair as you

130
00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:26.340
can see the arrow pointing to it there
at the bottom center of the screen.

131
00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:32.480
Everyone of any import had turned out
to hear the music of the aging master.

132
00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:39.190
But because of his success with
the London symphonies Haydn ended up

133
00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:42.270
with a ton of money he made
from those London symphonies.

134
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:45.680
About 1.2 million dollars
in money of today.

135
00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.760
And with it he bought,

136
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:52.670
bought a splendid new house in what
was then the suburbs of Vienna.

137
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:55.970
Now it's more or
less in the central district.

138
00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.200
It was here that he died in 1809.

139
00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:05.330
The last music he played was
a melody called the Emperor's hymn.

140
00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:09.970
He played this melody everyday on
the piano before retiring at night,

141
00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:14.990
and there's a story behind this melody,

142
00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:22.330
in 1796 the armies in Napoleon Bonaparte
had invaded the Austrian Empire.

143
00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:26.880
The French under Napoleon already had
their national anthem, the Marseillaise.

144
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:31.720
The English had God Save the Queen but
the Austrians had nothing.

145
00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.250
So, Haydn, being the most and

146
00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:36.930
famous, most important musician of
the day, was commissioned to write a hymn,

147
00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:41.780
a song, a anthem in praise of the emperor,
Emperor Franz Joseph II.

148
00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.680
It came to be called the Emperor's Hymn.

149
00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.180
Here's the melody part.

150
00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:54.979
And I'll try to,
I'll swing around here and play the tune.

151
00:10:54.979 --> 00:11:04.979
[MUSIC]

152
00:11:06.973 --> 00:11:08.575
And then that repeats, next phrase.

153
00:11:08.575 --> 00:11:18.575
[MUSIC]

154
00:11:21.041 --> 00:11:21.935
Last phrase.

155
00:11:21.935 --> 00:11:31.935
[MUSIC]

156
00:11:36.598 --> 00:11:41.263
Well Hayden was so pleased with that
melody that the next year 1797 he

157
00:11:41.263 --> 00:11:45.600
worked it into the slow
movement of a string quartet.

158
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:49.340
Now remember a string quarter is
usually written in four movements.

159
00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:50.580
Fast first movement.

160
00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.190
Slow second movement.

161
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:54.930
Minuet in trio fast finale.

162
00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:58.120
And of course it's played
by four instruments.

163
00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:04.245
First and second violins, viola and cello.

164
00:12:04.245 --> 00:12:11.020
And, Haydn used this slow
second movement of a string

165
00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:16.360
quartet to show case
his new Emperor's Hymn,

166
00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:20.330
he used it as the melody for
a set of variations.

167
00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.730
Thus we have a movement in theme and

168
00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:27.180
variation form, with the emperor's
hymn providing the theme.

169
00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:32.260
Haydn more or less single handedly
created the string quartet,

170
00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:37.130
music with four more or
less equal parts, equal players.

171
00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:38.760
As you see here.

172
00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:43.730
Here we are in variation two .The
cello has the emperor's theme.

173
00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:48.000
As you can see by the blue arrow.

174
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.244
Let me see if I can play
the cello part here.

175
00:12:49.244 --> 00:12:59.244
[MUSIC]

176
00:13:09.043 --> 00:13:13.320
>> Okay, that's the cello part.

177
00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.530
Now let's listen to this movement
of the Emperor's Quartet.

178
00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:20.950
The slow second movement in the Emperor's
Quartet based on the Emperor's Hymn.

179
00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:25.170
And it's performed here by
a young string quartet based at

180
00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:28.170
the New England Conservatory
of Music in Boston.

181
00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:30.240
The Quartet.

182
00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.078
As we start off.

183
00:13:31.078 --> 00:13:33.961
The theme is played by the first violin.

184
00:13:39.382 --> 00:13:44.793
[MUSIC]

185
00:13:44.793 --> 00:13:45.931
Phrase one is the theme.

186
00:13:45.931 --> 00:13:53.512
[MUSIC]

187
00:13:53.512 --> 00:13:59.280
Notice how the first violinist
is shaking that left hand

188
00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:05.178
to play bravado to give a richer
timbre tone to the pitch,

189
00:14:05.178 --> 00:14:08.277
[MUSIC]

190
00:14:08.277 --> 00:14:09.403
Phrase two

191
00:14:09.403 --> 00:14:19.403
[MUSIC]

192
00:14:24.535 --> 00:14:29.492
In phrase three.

193
00:14:29.492 --> 00:14:31.071
Texture here.

194
00:14:31.071 --> 00:14:33.250
Is homophonic they're all basically.

195
00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:34.615
Playing chords again.

196
00:14:34.615 --> 00:14:40.304
Tune plus chords.

197
00:14:40.304 --> 00:14:46.060
Repeated that third phrase.

198
00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:51.620
And of course we've got first violin,
second violin,

199
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.946
cello and viola on the far right.

200
00:14:54.946 --> 00:14:58.963
[MUSIC]

201
00:14:58.963 --> 00:14:59.531
Okay.

202
00:14:59.531 --> 00:15:04.810
First variation, who's got the melody now?

203
00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:10.190
Can you tell?

204
00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:18.450
Well, the second violin does.

205
00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:27.350
As the first violin plays counterpoint
against it, second phrase.

206
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:35.185
And generally speaking the counterpoint is
going along in rapid moving 16th notes.

207
00:15:35.185 --> 00:15:39.050
[MUSIC]

208
00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:44.665
Third phrase, obviously the cello and

209
00:15:44.665 --> 00:15:51.480
the viola don't play at
all in this variation.

210
00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:55.473
So it's just melody.

211
00:15:55.473 --> 00:16:04.745
Los accompany.

212
00:16:04.745 --> 00:16:09.584
Variation two.

213
00:16:09.584 --> 00:16:14.744
Clearly the large cello has.

214
00:16:14.744 --> 00:16:16.966
The Emperor's Theme here.

215
00:16:16.966 --> 00:16:26.765
[MUSIC]

216
00:16:26.765 --> 00:16:34.010
The other three instruments providing
accompaniment with light counterpoint

217
00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:42.252
[MUSIC]

218
00:16:42.252 --> 00:16:43.204
Second phrase.

219
00:16:43.204 --> 00:16:53.204
[MUSIC]

220
00:17:01.386 --> 00:17:02.210
Final phrase.

221
00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:11.545
[MUSIC]

222
00:17:11.545 --> 00:17:19.843
And repeated that final phrase.

223
00:17:19.843 --> 00:17:29.350
Okay, we're going to stop.

224
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:32.412
And as we proceed with the next slide,

225
00:17:32.412 --> 00:17:37.589
we'll see that we stopped exactly
where the cello was playing.

226
00:17:37.589 --> 00:17:44.271
[MUSIC]

227
00:17:44.271 --> 00:17:48.854
And so on we go, but we can also
see again on this screen the equal

228
00:17:48.854 --> 00:17:54.393
distribution of the music, typical of
a classical string quartet invented

229
00:17:54.393 --> 00:17:59.350
by Haydn with The Emperor's Hymn in
the cello part in the base part.

230
00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:04.480
Alright, let's review,
let's take a moment to review the life and

231
00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.674
music of Joseph Haydn.

232
00:18:05.674 --> 00:18:10.690
[INAUDIBLE] He's a representative
of the classical Viennese school of

233
00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:14.340
the late 18th and early 19th century.

234
00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:17.600
Educated musically for
the most part at the Cathedral of, of St.

235
00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.090
Stephen in Vienna.

236
00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:20.660
His patron was the Esterhazy.

237
00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:25.270
He was taken in their service in 1761.

238
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:27.320
Served them for 30 years.

239
00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:33.090
In 1790, he received a pension and went
into something akin to phased retirement.

240
00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:37.630
But still went off to London,
where he composed his 12 last symphonies,

241
00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:39.770
the London symphonies.

242
00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:43.260
Partially resident there in
the year 1971 through 1795.

243
00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:47.390
They were performed in
the Hanover Square Rooms, as we saw.

244
00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:53.150
The Emperor's Hymn was
created in the mid 1790s

245
00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:58.180
as a way of honoring the Emperor
of the Holy Roman Empire.

246
00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:01.790
But notice,
today that's actually the national anthem

247
00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:05.040
of both Austria and Germany.

248
00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:08.150
So every time Germany and
Austria does it occasionally but

249
00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:15.620
most often Germany wins a medal at the
Olympics or the Germans win the World Cup.

250
00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:20.430
What you're hearing a national
anthem is actually the music of

251
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:26.580
Joseph Hayden that he himself subsequently
incorporated in the Emperor's Quarter.

252
00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:31.770
And, again, Haydn more or
less invented this genre of the quartet.

253
00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:36.702
Which, to paraphrase,
paraphrase the famous Johann Wolfgang von

254
00:19:36.702 --> 00:19:41.816
Goethe is a civilized conversation
of learned and, indeed, equal.

255
00:19:41.816 --> 00:19:43.012
Participants.
