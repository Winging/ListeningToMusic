00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.794
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:07.794 --> 00:00:11.025
Of all the characters that I've
ever run into, or read about.

3
00:00:11.025 --> 00:00:15.440
Picasso, Michelangelo, Shakespeare,
Isaac Newton, Einstein.

4
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.610
There are two that stand out in my mind.

5
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.900
To Leonardo Da Vinci and Mozart.

6
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.710
Fascinating personalities, and geniuses of
the short that you just can't understand.

7
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.970
You can't fathom how
they did what they did.

8
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.600
And Mozart is very special.

9
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.950
I think he's the most interesting of all
characters to stud because he was just

10
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.040
that, a real character,
an endlessly fascinating personality.

11
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.880
And we know a lot about Mozart because,
fortunately,

12
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:54.700
he lived in an age before emails and
text messages that we could delete.

13
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.280
He was a very social creature,
a real party animal.

14
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.970
And he liked to communicate,
he liked to communicate in his music, and

15
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.100
you like to communicate in prose.

16
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.400
And to do so in the 18th century
you had to write letters.

17
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.340
And he did,
more than 600 of them surviving.

18
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:18.620
Flowing between him and members of
his family, mostly with his father.

19
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.210
Now Beethoven is a special piece
of work too, another character.

20
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:28.360
But if you wanna study a genius
Mozart is the mother lode of genius.

21
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.270
Genius as prodigy, genius as creator.

22
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.860
A genius who burned bright and
then died young.

23
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:36.570
That was Mozart.

24
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:38.960
But let's start.

25
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.640
Let's take a look at his life.

26
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.360
Here's a map of Salzburg.

27
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.045
Then a city of about 20,000.

28
00:01:47.045 --> 00:01:50.520
Today a city of more than
ten times that number.

29
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.300
Owing mostly to Mozart and
the Salzburg festival and

30
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.300
all the people that come there,
and the commerce that it supports.

31
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.540
So, let's take a tour here,
through Mozart's life.

32
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.890
Here's the Mozart's, Mozart Birthhouse,

33
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.400
as you see there in Salzburg,
up in third floor, there.

34
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.730
And I'm going to point out here,
nearby, only about two blocks away,

35
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.310
is the famous St. Peter's Abbey, and those
of you who are fans of The Sound of Music,

36
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.060
that's where Maria was actually a nun
at one point, was a Benedictine house.

37
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.280
Anyway, let's stay on
point here with Mozart.

38
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.380
Mozart was a child prodigy,
and you see here a minuet,

39
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.620
Minuetto del Signoro [FOREIGN]
Mozart 16 December 1761.

40
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.090
So he was five years old
when he wrote this minuet.

41
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.960
It's actually in the hand
of his father but

42
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.430
nonetheless he was five when he
was writing this kind of thing.

43
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.200
But because father Leopold realized that

44
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.190
he had on his hands a genius and
he was an enterprising sort.

45
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.740
He packed up the entire family and
off they went to Vienna where he showcased

46
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.230
the boy's extraordinary
skills to the emperor and

47
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.000
the empress, empress Maria Theresa and
here's a set of clothes,

48
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.910
suit Given to young Mozart by
the empress Maria Theresa.

49
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.800
So after a visit to Vienna
back they are in Salzburg and

50
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.490
then they set off for
a three year grand tour of Europe.

51
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.950
They're heading actually they swing
up into the North countries but

52
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.660
they land initially in Paris and
here they again play for the aristocracy.

53
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.585
This is Father Leopold at the violin.

54
00:03:29.585 --> 00:03:34.020
Sister singing, and
Wolfgang at the keyboard.

55
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.730
Notice where his feet are.

56
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.470
They don't come close
to touching the floor,

57
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.950
shows you how young he was and,
in a way, how diminutive he was.

58
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.086
Well, after a year in Paris,
off they go now to London and

59
00:03:50.086 --> 00:03:54.804
here in London,
Mozart writes his first symphony.

60
00:03:54.804 --> 00:04:03.276
[MUSIC]

61
00:04:03.276 --> 00:04:08.129
So this is Mozart's first
symphony dictated to

62
00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:11.900
his sister in London at the age of 8.

63
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.760
Okay let's move on.

64
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.920
As the Mozarts were moving on.

65
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.100
So after London they went back to the low
countries and came back down into Paris.

66
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.720
Stayed again in Paris and

67
00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.850
then made their way home after three years
to this triumphant tour to Salzburg.

68
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.090
And then rather shortly there
after off the Mozart's go

69
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.890
in to Italy down through Verona and
over to Milan.

70
00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.178
Here's a portrait of Mozart.

71
00:04:38.178 --> 00:04:42.926
[MUSIC]

72
00:04:42.926 --> 00:04:46.384
The age of about 17,

73
00:04:46.384 --> 00:04:51.662
playing again the G minor symphony

74
00:04:51.662 --> 00:04:56.758
that we listened to a bit before,

75
00:04:56.758 --> 00:05:02.410
and saw the music animation before.

76
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.790
Now at age 25, in 1781,
Mozart moves to and of course,

77
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.550
we have seen this slide
before that's Vienna.

78
00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.110
Here we are in the center,
the center of Vienna again with the St.

79
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.194
Stephen's Cathedral.

80
00:05:12.194 --> 00:05:16.200
And this has indicated where
Mozart spent a great deal of

81
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.780
time around this cathedral and
he was actually, his body was actually

82
00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.620
displayed in state there in
the chapel where the blue arrow is.

83
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:31.140
And then his funeral was given and
the body was buried here.

84
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.770
Out to the South there
is that monastery again.

85
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.410
Out to the South in St. Mark's cemetery.

86
00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.850
We can't be sure it was said that
Mozart was buried as a pauper,

87
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.085
that's really not the case.

88
00:05:43.085 --> 00:05:47.400
85% of the general population were
buried in these mass graves for

89
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.070
reasons that we need not go into.

90
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:52.230
So there was Mozart buried in the St.
Mark's Cemetery.

91
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:57.040
And legend had it that an eagle-eyed
grave keeper was paying attention to

92
00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.610
where Mozart was actually buried and dug
up his skull and in the course of time,

93
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.110
that skull has made it's
way back to the Mozartiem.

94
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.350
Is this really the skull of Mozart?

95
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:12.130
Can we learn anything about Mozart or
how he thought or

96
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.410
how he composed on
the basis of this skull?

97
00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:15.340
Is this really Mozart?

98
00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.260
We don't really know although people are
going over into the Saint Sebastian church

99
00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.950
on the other side of the river
from the Geburtshaus and

100
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:28.890
into this cemetery where many of
the relatives of Mozart are now buried,

101
00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:33.350
looking for samples of DNA that
they can match with that skull.

102
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:41.640
Well, this is taking us rather far afield
here so let's get back to Mozart's music.

103
00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:46.020
I'd like to start with a scene
from the film Amadeus.

104
00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.900
It's a spectacular film.

105
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.100
It won eight Academy Awards, I think.

106
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:59.470
The Mozart that you see in Amadeus often
Is not really true to the way Mozart was.

107
00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.740
But sometimes it is and
it's a fascinating and

108
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.690
very insightful representation in so
many ways.

109
00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:10.370
So sometimes Mozart behaved this way,
often times he didn't.

110
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.800
But I'd like to start with
my favorite scene here.

111
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.360
And it's a scene in which Saluary,

112
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:23.150
a supposed arch enemy of
Mozart has received a raft of

113
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:29.440
scores from Mozart taken surreptitiously
by his wife and being shown to Saluary.

114
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.220
And Saluary is astonished because,

115
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:35.700
as he turns the pages of these, he
realizes that this is all completely new,

116
00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:40.990
unknown music, and it shows no sign
whatsoever of actually being worked on.

117
00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.960
Sort of miraculous conception here, so

118
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:48.705
let's watch this really very special,
beautiful scene from Amadeus.

119
00:07:48.705 --> 00:07:54.605
>> These are originals?

120
00:07:54.605 --> 00:07:55.826
>> Um-hum.

121
00:07:55.826 --> 00:08:04.073
[MUSIC]

122
00:08:04.073 --> 00:08:06.283
So this is Mozart's
music from the Flute And

123
00:08:06.283 --> 00:08:08.441
Harp Concerto playing in the background.

124
00:08:08.441 --> 00:08:18.441
[MUSIC]

125
00:08:28.895 --> 00:08:29.674
>> Astounding.

126
00:08:29.674 --> 00:08:31.680
>> Mozart's symphony
now in the background.

127
00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.790
>> It was beyond belief.

128
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:38.780
These were first and only drafts of music.

129
00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:43.645
But they showed no
corrections of any kind.

130
00:08:43.645 --> 00:08:45.725
Not one.

131
00:08:45.725 --> 00:08:49.440
[MUSIC]

132
00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:54.300
He had simply written down music
already finished in his head.

133
00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:57.510
Page after page of it.

134
00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:59.920
As if he were just taking dictation.

135
00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.922
>> And this is the mass in C minor here.

136
00:09:01.922 --> 00:09:06.020
[MUSIC]

137
00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.389
Soprano solo.

138
00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:09.306
>> And music.

139
00:09:09.306 --> 00:09:14.140
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> Finished as no music has ever finished.

140
00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:20.600
Displace one note, and
it would be diminishment.

141
00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:26.157
Displace one phrase, and
the structure would fall.

142
00:09:26.157 --> 00:09:30.917
[MUSIC]

143
00:09:30.917 --> 00:09:33.751
>> It was clear to me.

144
00:09:33.751 --> 00:09:38.718
That sound I had heard in the Archbishop's
palace had been no accident.

145
00:09:38.718 --> 00:09:41.529
[MUSIC]

146
00:09:41.529 --> 00:09:46.540
Here again was the very voice of God.

147
00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:49.180
>> Okay, well, we'll pause it here.

148
00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:50.010
It's a beautiful scene.

149
00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:52.590
But is it really accurate?

150
00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:57.380
Is it really accurate, did Mozart's music
really come down directly from God,

151
00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.690
untouched almost by human hand?

152
00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:02.170
Well, here is an autograph of Mozart.

153
00:10:03.182 --> 00:10:05.260
It's actually the same music
we were just listening to,

154
00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.580
it is the autograph of
the Kyrie of the C minor mass.

155
00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.630
Do we see much in the way
of correction there?

156
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:12.090
No, virtually none.

157
00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:16.400
As we turn over to the next page, yes
there is a smudge in the third line and

158
00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.730
a smudge down toward the bottom.

159
00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:19.008
He was changing notes here.

160
00:10:19.008 --> 00:10:21.160
The ink wasn't completely dry and

161
00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:25.920
he was still able to correct
it before that ink did dry.

162
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.711
Here's the most extreme case of
Mozart working on something,

163
00:10:29.711 --> 00:10:32.150
correcting something, that I know of.

164
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:36.450
It's from the C Minor Piano Concerto, in
which he wrote the right hand of the piano

165
00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:40.710
once, and then twice, and
then a third and indeed a fourth time.

166
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:43.710
But this is exceptional because the norm

167
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:48.380
is what we find here in
the D minor piano concerto.

168
00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:53.440
D minor piano concerto, which it looks
like more or less Mozart is in fact

169
00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:58.730
just streaming this all out
with very little labor.

170
00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:06.120
Well, let's delve into Mozart's
music a little more deeply here.

171
00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:11.350
Let's focus on a movement of
a piano concerto, written 1785 for

172
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:16.300
Vienna, performed in the theater,
the that we had seen earlier.

173
00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:21.600
It's called the Elvira Madigan Concerto
because it was used in a film some 30 or

174
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.940
40 years ago of that name.

175
00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:27.310
We can get a sense of how it's
put together by watching another

176
00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:28.950
animated video.

177
00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:34.160
This again by Steve Malinowski.

178
00:11:37.411 --> 00:11:41.323
Steve has color coded this
one with the accompaniment.

179
00:11:41.323 --> 00:11:42.448
Just these chords.

Listen to this

184
00:11:55.649 --> 00:11:58.319

That note, it's a sharp.

185
00:11:58.319 --> 00:12:00.907
It gives it a intensity that [INAUDIBLE]

187
00:12:01.685 --> 00:12:03.786

[MUSIC].

189
00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:07.060
Here comes another one
of those dramatic notes

190
00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.302
[MUSIC],

191
00:12:09.302 --> 00:12:10.205
there.

192
00:12:10.205 --> 00:12:12.234
[MUSIC]
[INAUDIBLE] Just a moment of tug at your

00:12:12.924 --> 00:12:19.780
Melody up above dives down low.

195
00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.980
Melody repeated now, up a step.

196
00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:24.736
Dives down low.

198
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:30.878

200
00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:32.574
To a melodic sequence.

[MUSIC]

202
00:12:34.257 --> 00:12:37.990
This one's falling down.

203
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:40.570
Melodic sequences that
fall down tend to relax.

204
00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:44.945
This is very beautiful,
it's also very relaxing.

205
00:12:44.945 --> 00:12:47.649
[MUSIC]

206
00:12:47.649 --> 00:12:51.330
All of the accompaniment is very simple,
the melodies ever so simple.

[MUSIC]

208
00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:55.822
Concluding phrase.

209
00:12:55.822 --> 00:12:58.608
We think we're coming to a cadence.

210
00:12:58.608 --> 00:13:00.385
But he surprises us,

211
00:13:00.385 --> 00:13:02.771
[MUSIC]

212
00:13:02.771 --> 00:13:07.360
there, by going to a minor chord
instead of the expected meter.

213
00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:10.899
He's gonna do a fly over,
starting to land again.

214
00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:15.610
And finally this time he
lands back on the tonic.

215
00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:19.188
[MUSIC]

216
00:13:19.188 --> 00:13:22.590
At which point the pianist comes in.

217
00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:27.576
Notice again how simple the music is.

218
00:13:27.576 --> 00:13:31.396
[MUSIC]

219
00:13:31.396 --> 00:13:32.335
First phrase.

00:13:32.335 --> 00:13:33.937
[MUSIC]

221
00:13:33.937 --> 00:13:37.004
Inflection and the harmony is just
these plunking little chords and

222
00:13:37.004 --> 00:13:38.094
triplets underneath.

223
00:13:38.094 --> 00:13:41.971
[MUSIC]

224
00:13:41.971 --> 00:13:42.516
Answer,

00:13:42.516 --> 00:13:46.093
[MUSIC]

226
00:13:46.093 --> 00:13:47.253
inflection.

227
00:13:47.253 --> 00:13:51.316
[MUSIC]

228
00:13:51.316 --> 00:13:53.980
Okay, maybe we'll pause here.

229
00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:00.240
So this music has the simplest
of musical textures.

230
00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:04.770
But sometimes Mozart wrote
a very complicated texture.

231
00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:11.165
So, again, you can make the most beautiful
things out of the simplest of materials.

232
00:14:11.165 --> 00:14:16.260
Yet at the same time, he had the capacity
to write very, very complex music,

233
00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.880
and sometimes a very complex
music will get him into trouble.

234
00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:26.830
And for this, let's go to
another video clip from Amadeus.

235
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:34.530
Here we have the Emperor, and
he's about to congratulate Mozart for

236
00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:40.060
the successful premiere of
The Abduction from the Seraglio.

237
00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.710
He thinks it's great, but not perfect.

238
00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:47.120
>> Well now, Mozart, a good effort.

239
00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.940
Oh, well, decidedly that.

240
00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:49.930
An excellent effort.

241
00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:55.480
You have shown us something,
Quite new tonight.

242
00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:59.540
>> It is new, it is, isn't it sire?

243
00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:00.730
>> Yes indeed.

244
00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:03.420
>> So then you liked it?

245
00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:05.370
You really liked it sire?

246
00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:12.083
>> Well of course I did, it's very good,
of course now and then just now and

247
00:15:12.083 --> 00:15:18.830
then, it seemed a touch [CROSSTALK]
>> This is based on a true event.

248
00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:21.670
>> Well, I mean,
occasionally it seems to have

249
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:23.540
>> An exchange between the emperor and

250
00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:24.900
Mozart
>> Oh, how should one say?

251
00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.100
How shall one say directly?

252
00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.410
>> Too many notes, Your Majesty.

253
00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:33.950
>> Exactly.

254
00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:35.180
Very well put.

255
00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:35.740
Too many notes.

256
00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:38.460
>> I don't understand.

257
00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:44.350
There are just as many notes, majesty,
as are required, neither more nor less.

258
00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:47.610
>> Well my dear fellow,
there are in fact only so

259
00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:51.479
many notes the ear can hear
in the course of a year.

260
00:15:51.479 --> 00:15:53.040
>> [LAUGH] Alright, let's pause it here.

261
00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.559
Too many notes, too many notes.

262
00:15:54.559 --> 00:15:57.253
Well, what's at issue here?

263
00:15:57.253 --> 00:16:02.097
Well let me see if I can reify this
by means of an example Let's turn

264
00:16:02.097 --> 00:16:06.250
to an image,
musical example of the Jupiter Symphony.

265
00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:12.580
And here we have a symphony in the last
movement of which Mozart strung out

266
00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:18.600
over a period of about seven minutes,
five different musical themes.

267
00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:23.020
We've got a first theme, and then a first
theme part two, and then a transition

268
00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:26.540
theme, and then a second theme, and
a second theme part two, and so on.

269
00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:31.450
What we don't realize is, and
maybe Mozart didn't realize this himself

270
00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:36.330
as he was proceeding, was that all of
these themes could actually be combined.

271
00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:37.510
So here are the themes.

272
00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:41.043
[MUSIC]

273
00:16:41.043 --> 00:16:42.060

275
00:16:46.565 --> 00:16:48.701

281
00:17:02.635 --> 00:17:07.270
Okay, could those five
all possibly go together?

282
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:09.180
Well, that's what Mozart does.

283
00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:12.850
We hardly hear it, but
it's very dense counterpoint.

284
00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:16.120
It's sort of a contrapuntal
fireworks here.

285
00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:20.930
Let's give a listen by
means of another musical

286
00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:25.148

291
00:17:34.302 --> 00:17:38.809
You know, all of so
I can't keep track of them all at once.

292
00:17:38.809 --> 00:17:48.809
[MUSIC]

293
00:17:55.298 --> 00:17:57.180
Okay, let's pause it there.

294
00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:59.160
So that's an introduction
to the music of Mozart.

295
00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:06.148
Which can be sublimely simply or and
at the same time devilishly complex.

296
00:18:06.148 --> 00:18:09.690
But stick around For
a Mozart bonus, if you will.

297
00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:12.080
Another favorite scene from Amadeus,

298
00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:16.450
here Mozart is about to be
presented to Emperor Joseph II.

299
00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:21.700
Salieri has written an entry march
in honor of Mozart's arrival,

300
00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:24.090
his first presentation at court.

301
00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:29.120
The Emperor, who studies piano with
Salieri, has played this piece only once.

302
00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.380
Only once.

303
00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:35.410
And now on this one hearing,
Mozart will play it back.

304
00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:41.930
The point of this fictitious but
very truthful scene is to show two things.

305
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:47.690
One that Mozart is an extraordinary talent
he has an extraordinary musical memory.

306
00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:51.680
And that two he can Improvise,

307
00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:56.380
riff on any piece of music
given by anybody at any time.

308
00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:02.920
And that capacity sometimes
makes other people mere mortals,

309
00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:06.380
such as we, very jealous.

310
00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:08.840
>> If you want,
it's already here in my head.

311
00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:09.340
>> What?

312
00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:11.270
From one hearing only?

313
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:14.062
>> I think so Sire, yes.

314
00:19:18.569 --> 00:19:19.683
>> Show us.

315
00:19:23.443 --> 00:19:25.755
>> Okay, this is Salieri's March.

316
00:19:25.755 --> 00:19:27.979

Of course, this actor Tom Holka is
not actually playing this keyboard.

This keyboard has no strings on it.

324
00:19:54.025 --> 00:19:55.420

that the game is up.

An extraordinary human being, character,
who wrote equally extraordinary music.
