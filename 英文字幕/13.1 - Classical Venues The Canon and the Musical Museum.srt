00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:10.025
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:11.901 --> 00:00:16.164
Remember we said in an earlier
session that the term classical music

3
00:00:16.164 --> 00:00:20.673
was coined in the 1830's and
applied generally to high art music.

4
00:00:20.673 --> 00:00:24.820
Running from roughly
Bach through Beethoven.

5
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.390
High art music sounds a bit snobby, and
indeed it is, and was, in the sense that

6
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.230
this music was generally music for
the upper middle class and above.

7
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.990
The aristocracy, nobility, whatever.

8
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.880
And it was music that was written down and
could be studied, so

9
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.660
if you were a learned high class dude or
dame this was your kind of music.

10
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.720
This was the sort of music
that you enjoyed listening to.

11
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.950
Everyone else in the 18th century was
listening to the equivalent of pop music,

12
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.250
unwritten, unstudied, folk music.

13
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.520
Another thing that happened at this time,

14
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.930
early 19th century,
music started to be thought of as art.

15
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.860
Again a high art and
not merely entertainment.

16
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:09.780
What do I mean by that?

17
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.490
Well up to the time of Beethoven all
music even what we would we call

18
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.680
classical music was disposable,
it was entertainment.

19
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.730
Entertainment that the listener
could pay attention to or not.

20
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.110
When they went to a concert,
audiences expected to hear new music.

21
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.920
Why would anyone want to hear old music?

22
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.990
Indeed, before 1800,

23
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.100
the concert was as much a social
event as it was a musical experience.

24
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.340
With rare exception, people talked,
drank, ate, played cards, flirted, and

25
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.200
wandered about, as you can see here.

26
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.790
Dogs ran freely on the ground floor and

27
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.680
armed guards roamed the theater
to maintain some sense of order.

28
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.560
At the blue arrow there,
you can see someone selling wine and

29
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:58.670
at the blue arrow to the right
they're selling fruit.

30
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.330
Several of the people aren't
even looking at the stage, but

31
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.270
they're turned around talking
to the people behind them.

32
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.240
This was sort of like going to
a football game, or a wrestling match.

33
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.840
Of course, this sometimes infuriated
Mozart when the audiences didn't listen,

34
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.040
and once he had a hissy fit in Paris,
in a high end salon when this happened.

35
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.860
But even Mozart wrote pop music,
entertainment music.

36
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.060
Not only in his operas but
also in his music for music boxes.

37
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.650
The sort of thing where you open
up the lid and the music plays.

38
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.590
This was actually the only recorded music,

39
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.600
the only kind of recorded music
that they had in those days.

40
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.660
He also wrote music, for a music box,
it was again to be played here

41
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.060
in a wax museum, sort of amusement park,
amusement house.

42
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.770
Bach, even Mozart too, wrote music to
played in coffee houses and cafe's.

43
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.880
Here in downtown Vienna we
see the Frauenhuber Cafe.

44
00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.230
It's actually the oldest surviving in
Vienna and it dates from the 18th century.

45
00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.870
Both, Mozart and Beethoven ate here from
time to time as the plaque on the front,

46
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.550
let me see if I can point to it here.

47
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.160
Here we go underneath the sign and
here's the street sign,

48
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.680
Gosse and here is the plaque.

49
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.040
It says that both, Mozart and
Beethoven had their music performed here.

50
00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.260
Now when we go inside,

51
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.650
you can see that this by our
standards is a rather smallish cafe.

52
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.690
Well, by the standards of
the 18th century, it's not.

53
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.220
Another place for music where the general
public could go was the court theater.

54
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.349
Here of course, to hear opera, but
also symphonies and concertos.

55
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.765
But the middle class was allowed
to go here too, not just nobility.

56
00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:48.960
As long as you were properly dressed and
could pay the admission fee, in you went.

57
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.820
There were also newly emergent
music only concert halls.

58
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.080
Halls just for music, no theatre.

59
00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.450
We've seen one of the earliest of these
in London, the Hanover Square Rooms,

60
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:02.730
actually one large room.

61
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.630
Here again,
we see the Hanover Square Rooms,

62
00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.880
from the outside as it was
in the 18th century, and

63
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.000
then as we go inside the Hanover Square
Room, as it looked in the 19th century.

64
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.780
Today much pop music is
performed in casinos.

65
00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.950
Garth Brooks,
Celine Dion in Las Vegas casinos.

66
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:28.750
I've heard Sting sing at
the Mohican Sons Casino in Connecticut.

67
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.620
Why the casino?

68
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.780
Well that's where
the people with money are.

69
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.860
And as Willy Sutton once famously said,
that's where the money is.

70
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.320
And that was true from Mozart's day too.

71
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.480
Here's the casino as it
looked in the 18th century.

72
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.390
It's called the Mehlgroube,
in a painting by Canaletto.

73
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.090
Mozart premiered some of his most
famous compositions in this casino.

74
00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.530
Now, here's how it looks today.

75
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.720
It survives as the Ambassador Hotel.

76
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.180
You can stay there and this is
the way the central room looks today.

77
00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.190
It's not large, but
Mozart would hire this hall.

78
00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.140
He'd hire the orchestra, write all the
music, have his piano carried over there,

79
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.460
sell tickets.

80
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.660
Anyone with the money to buy
a subscription series could go in and

81
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.230
hear Mozart's music in this casino.

82
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.310
And don't forget,
music was also performed in private homes.

83
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.990
Chamber music, of course, ti was called.

84
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.750
Here we see the outside of
Mozart's apartment from the 1780s.

85
00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:32.120
Now as we go inside,
this is the room in which Mozart and

86
00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.820
Haydn played string quartets together.

87
00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.550
Again, this very room in the year 1785.

88
00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:42.200
Now you have to visualize here Mozart and
Haydn and

89
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.280
Ditters playing Mozart's string
quartets in this very room.

90
00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.990
Now that's of course not really Haydn and
Mozart there.

91
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:54.020
But you have to use your imagination and
if you do so, you get the idea.

92
00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.520
So the era of Haydn and Mozart and
Beethoven, around 1800,

93
00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.700
is important because
things begin to change.

94
00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.770
Music was becoming more middle class,
more public.

95
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.790
And a Canon of Music was developing.

96
00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:14.340
A select repertoire of
pieces began to emerge.

97
00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.720
Our favorites of Bach and Handel and
Haydn and Mozart and Beethoven and

98
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.350
early Schubert.

99
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:22.920
Our earliest musical museum

100
00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.600
of the classics played in
room such as we just saw.

101
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.540
Listeners entering this early
music museum, theater or

102
00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:36.130
public concert hall increasingly
came in order to hear the classics.

103
00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:41.290
Tried and true favorites and they brought
with them certain expectations as to how

104
00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:42.670
music ought to sound.

105
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:46.000
They had expectations
with regard to genre,

106
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.440
what type of piece they were hearing and
the form that it would follow.

107
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.728
Let's see how this plays out.
