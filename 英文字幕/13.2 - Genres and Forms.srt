2
00:00:07.587 --> 00:00:11.045
When you go to a concert, where do you go?

3
00:00:11.045 --> 00:00:12.003
A bar?

4
00:00:12.003 --> 00:00:14.004
Football stadium for a rock concert?

5
00:00:14.004 --> 00:00:16.150
An opera house?

6
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.550
Where you go, the venue,
determines what you hear.

7
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.470
Blues, grunge, rock?

8
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.970
Hip hop.

9
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:22.530
Beethoven.

10
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:23.240
Tchaikovsky.

11
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.740
Wagner.

12
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.490
In the classical era, as we saw,
you'd go to a private home

13
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.380
to hear a string quartet, but usually to a
theatre to hear a symphony or a concerto.

14
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.530
Let's look now at some of these genres,

15
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.780
in terms of musical forms,
mood, and even tempo.

16
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.400
So we're gonna start, again, with genres.

17
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.530
As you can see,
we've got the genre of the symphony.

18
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.040
It's played by a symphony orchestra.

19
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.880
Actually, that's why we call it
a symphony orchestra, because this thing,

20
00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.460
this performing group, the orchestra, most
frequently played a thing called, a genre,

21
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.450
called a symphony.

22
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.550
So we call it a symphony orchestra.

23
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.170
The performing group of a string quartet,
well,

24
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.810
it played this thing called a string
quartet, a genre called a string quartet.

25
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.010
Of course,
a concerto is played by an orchestra, and

26
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.750
usually a soloist fronting that orchestra.

27
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:18.260
Sonata?

28
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.210
Well, sonata could be writing for
piano, or for

29
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.820
another instrument such as the cello or
violin accompanied by a piano.

30
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.980
Now, the four previous genres that
we've looked at here, of course,

31
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:30.920
are all instrumental.

32
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.610
There was a fifth, opera, and
we'll discuss that as we proceed.

33
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.340
So let's move on now.

34
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.030
We're going to look at how this works,
starting with the classical symphony and

35
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.320
the string quartet, beginning with,
well, let's get down to the bottom.

36
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.400
We'll start with tempo.

37
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.650
Notice that we have,
with the symphony and the string quartet,

38
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.580
four movements, fast, slow,
lively, and then fast at the end.

39
00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.280
As to mood, well,
the first movement's serious, substantive,

40
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.790
yet also at a fast tempo.

41
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.590
Second is a contrasting movement.

42
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.300
It is oftentimes lyrical and tender.

43
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.250
Third is a bit lighter,

44
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.350
more elegant, sometimes spirited
if it's a case of a scherzo.

45
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.270
But more normally dense like
in the spirit of a minuet.

46
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.500
And then, finally, a bright lighthearted,
sometimes humorous farewell.

47
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.690
A finale, the last movement.

48
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.618
As to form, we see that the first movement
is almost always written in a form that

49
00:02:32.618 --> 00:02:36.150
we'll spend a great deal of time on,
the sonata-allegro form.

50
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.270
Second movement can be in ternary form,
sometimes in theme and variation form,

51
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.150
sometimes in rondo form.

52
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:48.290
Third movement, a minuet or a scherzo,
is almost always in ternary form.

53
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.290
And the finale can be sonata-allegro,
theme and

54
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.210
variations, rondo,
occasionally even in fugal form.

55
00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:02.475
So those are our form, mood and tempos for
the symphony and the string quartet.

56
00:03:02.475 --> 00:03:07.100
Let's go on now to look at
the concerto and the sonata.

57
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.230
Here, as you can see,
that sort of middle-ish

58
00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.960
dance movement has been removed leaving
us with tempos of fast, slow, fast.

59
00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.820
The moods, however, remain the same.

60
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.420
Sort of serious for the first movement.

61
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.390
Lyrical and tender for the second.

62
00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.760
Bright, uplifting, happy for
the third and final movement.

63
00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.420
As to form,
we're keeping our same forms here.

64
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.360
First movement sonata allegro form.

65
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.480
Second movement can be any one of several.

66
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.590
You can read those there.

67
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.090
Same thing with the third movement,
the finale.

68
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.500
Any one of several.

69
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.790
All right.
Let's look now at a couple of real

70
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.850
examples here, and
we're going to turn to a slide

71
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.110
that foregrounds Mozart's famous
Eine kleine Nachtmuzik and

72
00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:58.710
Haydn's Symphony Number 94,
written in 1791 but premiered in 1792.

73
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.320
The surprise symphony.

74
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.260
And again, you can see the tempos
of the four movements for

75
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.175
the Eine kleine Nachtmusik,
the four surviving movements for this.

76
00:04:11.175 --> 00:04:13.790
Sonata-allegro, always the first here.

77
00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.950
Then rondo happens to be the form,

78
00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.500
slow rondo happens to be
the form of the second movement.

79
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.170
Ternary form for the third movement.

80
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.910
And rondo, but
this time a fast rondo for the finale.

81
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.250
The surprise symphony, again,
sonata-allegro in primary position there.

82
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.257
Theme and variations.

83
00:04:31.257 --> 00:04:33.060
We'll hear that in just a moment.

84
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.080
The famous slow movement
of the surprise symphony.

85
00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.110
We have a minuet and trio in ternary form.

86
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.020
And, finally, the finale.

87
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.220
This time, also in sonata-allegro form.

88
00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.600
And now, for a review of terms.

89
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.410
High art music.

90
00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.890
Well, as we said,
something that is written and studied and

91
00:04:53.890 --> 00:05:00.300
usually involves a degree of music theory,
it is learned music as we had indicated.

92
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.920
Venue.

93
00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.130
Very simple idea here.

94
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.810
Simply the place of performance.

95
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:04.560
Canon.

96
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.500
Well, a canon is a standard repertoire.

97
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.990
You can have canon in literature.

98
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.340
You can have a canon in art.

99
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.620
You can have a canon in music.

100
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.100
A standard cohort.

101
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.110
A publicly accepted works of art.

102
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.730
Genre.

103
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.010
Well, that's a very simple idea.

104
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.870
Simply means type or kind of music.

105
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:23.420
Form.
Well,

106
00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:29.060
that's a little more difficult to define,
but a sequence of auditory units

107
00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:34.260
that can be identified and
separated in terms of the thing itself,

108
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.340
a repetition of the thing itself,
a variation of the thing itself,

109
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:43.100
a contrast with the thing itself, and
perhaps a return to the thing itself.

110
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:48.280
All of these auditorially create
musical form just the way

111
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:54.260
that items in space visually can
create form in architecture.

112
00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.374
Okay.
Let's turn to some music now,

113
00:05:56.374 --> 00:05:59.336
music that demonstrates
what we've just learned.

114
00:05:59.336 --> 00:06:09.336
