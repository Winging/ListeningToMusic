00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.494
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:10.494 --> 00:00:13.780
Now let's work through some of
this classical musical forms.

3
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.160
Starting with ternary form, which we first
met I gave an example with Beethoven,

4
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.330
in our introductory
session on musical form.

5
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.900
Remember Beethoven's Fur Elise?

6
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.770
Ternary form has been around
ever since music, really.

7
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.290
Ever since recorded musical time.

8
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.470
At least since the 9th century.

9
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.820
It produces A, B, A musical form,
or home, away, home.

10
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.729
Here's a Mozart sonata
that uses ternary form.

11
00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:47.360
The middle movement of K545.

12
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.030
K stands for Ludwig von Kochel,
who was a 19th century German

13
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.390
musicologist who gave us a chronologically
list of the pieces of Mozart.

14
00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.719
This sonata in principle is
the 545th piece the Mozart wrote.

15
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.050
And this one was written
by piano teacher Mozart.

16
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.490
He composed it for his beginning students.

17
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.010
You know the first movement,

18
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.040
which is written in sonata allegro form,
by the way.

19
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.805
But let me remind you how it goes.

20
00:01:17.805 --> 00:01:27.805
[MUSIC]

21
00:01:32.164 --> 00:01:36.710
And so we're going to turn
to the second movement here.

22
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.880
And I'll just talk off the music for
awhile.

23
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.440
So, here's the slow
contrasting second movement.

24
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.915
It happens to begin in ternary form.

25
00:01:44.915 --> 00:01:54.915
[MUSIC]

26
00:01:56.953 --> 00:01:58.240
That's the opening.

27
00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.506
Notice in the second movement,
both here in the second

28
00:02:03.506 --> 00:02:08.206
movement [SOUND] and
in the first movement [SOUND].

29
00:02:08.206 --> 00:02:09.910
That's called Alberti bass.

30
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.540
Just a little decoration.

31
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.145
It's a kind of fingerprint of the music of
the classical period because it only comes

32
00:02:15.145 --> 00:02:18.367
in during the classical period and
disappears with the classical period.

33
00:02:18.367 --> 00:02:21.327
So we have our opening theme
here with the Alberti base.

34
00:02:21.327 --> 00:02:28.026
You just take [SOUND] a chord and
turn it into a [SOUND] triad, like that.

35
00:02:28.026 --> 00:02:29.071
It's kind of a funk base

36
00:02:29.071 --> 00:02:33.529
[MUSIC]

37
00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:37.420
Of the 18th century.

38
00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.100
Easy, simple way of making things sound
more complex than they actually are.

39
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.155
In any event, here we are,
ternary form, beginning.

40
00:02:44.155 --> 00:02:48.984
[MUSIC]

41
00:02:48.984 --> 00:02:51.027
That's our opening idea, A.

42
00:02:51.027 --> 00:02:52.107
[SOUND] And, it ends here.

43
00:02:52.107 --> 00:02:54.846
Now, at the end, of A,
suddenly he picks it up and goes here.

44
00:02:54.846 --> 00:03:04.846
[MUSIC]

45
00:03:05.922 --> 00:03:06.920
Well, that's a different key.

46
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.311
We were here [SOUND].

47
00:03:09.311 --> 00:03:11.923
Now we're up here [SOUND],
and we have a different idea.

48
00:03:11.923 --> 00:03:15.371
[SOUND] Eventually,

49
00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:20.042
he works his way back here.

50
00:03:20.042 --> 00:03:21.838
[SOUND] And we're back in.

51
00:03:21.838 --> 00:03:25.483
[MUSIC]

52
00:03:25.483 --> 00:03:27.630
All right, so let's take a look
at what we've seen so far.

53
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.890
Let's go on to the next slide.

54
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.505
So, here we are in the B section again
where you picked it up and moved.

55
00:03:33.505 --> 00:03:40.092
[SOUND] And here's our contrasting
B that you see on the screen there.

56
00:03:40.092 --> 00:03:44.190
[MUSIC]

57
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:50.691
And eventually he works his way back
[SOUND] to the large A that you see.

58
00:03:50.691 --> 00:04:00.691
[MUSIC]

59
00:04:15.848 --> 00:04:18.040
A couple of things I want to
call your attention to there.

60
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.640
Did you notice there, the bottom system,

61
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.245
at the first blue arrow
where we have this.

62
00:04:25.245 --> 00:04:29.512
[MUSIC]

63
00:04:29.512 --> 00:04:30.750
Did Mozart do there?

64
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.746
[SOUND] What kind of scale is that?

65
00:04:33.746 --> 00:04:38.971
[SOUND] Just to give it
a little bit of extra zest.

66
00:04:38.971 --> 00:04:41.304
Yes, it is in fact a chromatic scale.

67
00:04:41.304 --> 00:04:46.377
[MUSIC]

68
00:04:46.377 --> 00:04:48.890
Every note of the scale
is being used there.

69
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.750
Then we're over here at the star.

70
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.327
[MUSIC]

71
00:04:55.327 --> 00:04:57.544
That's a particularly
poignant moment there.

72
00:04:57.544 --> 00:05:00.330
[MUSIC]

73
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:01.549
He could've done that.

74
00:05:01.549 --> 00:05:05.008
[MUSIC]

75
00:05:05.008 --> 00:05:07.621
Could've written it that way or
could've written it.

76
00:05:07.621 --> 00:05:12.589
[MUSIC]

77
00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:13.924
But he chose to do this.

78
00:05:13.924 --> 00:05:16.768
[MUSIC]

79
00:05:16.768 --> 00:05:18.580
That chromatic inflection again.

80
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.050
So it's sort of typical of Mozart.

81
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.150
To, give a little bit of extra
spice to his music by means of

82
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.010
chromatic inflection.

83
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.950
But the main point here,
of course, is ternary form.

84
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:33.740
A, B, and A slightly varied here,
or home, away, home.

85
00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.985
So, that's a quick review
of ternary reform.

86
00:05:35.985 --> 00:05:40.610
Ternary reform is much
like the more expansive

87
00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.730
sonata allegro form
that we'll now explore.
