00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.565
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:07.565 --> 00:00:12.181
All right now we come to the mother lode
of musical form, the big ticket item,

3
00:00:12.181 --> 00:00:17.860
the King Kong of musical form, whatever
you want to call it, sonata allegro form.

4
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.230
Why is it so important?

5
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.180
Well because it's the most
frequently used of the classical and

6
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.100
romantic era forms and it opens most
multi-movement classical genres.

7
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:35.440
It's the form that begins a symphony,
a string quartet, a concerto or a sonata.

8
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.630
Indeed we get our term sonata
allegro form from the sonata.

9
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.920
Let's go back to the slide of
the concerto and the sonata.

10
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.550
Sonatas begin with
movements that are fast.

11
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.410
So the term sonata-allegro
is taken from this process.

12
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.280
First movements in sonatas went this way.

13
00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.360
They were fast and
they went according to this form, so

14
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.250
we call it sonata-allegro form.

15
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.080
Sonata-allegro form has much in common
with ternary form as you'll remember from

16
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.470
our previous segment,
ternary form is A B A, home away home.

17
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.790
But now, let's see how it's fleshed out,

18
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.385
how it's expanded into
sonata-allegro form.

19
00:01:20.385 --> 00:01:24.620
Sonata-allegro form as you can see,

20
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.850
like ternary form has three parts,
exposition, development, recap.

21
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.030
Home, away, home.

22
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.760
First theme in the exposition.

23
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.760
Within that exposition
the first theme then moves

24
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.910
by means of a transition that
modulates to a new second theme and

25
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.840
then ultimately a closing theme,
that exposition can be repeated.

26
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.310
Then we go on to the development section.

27
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.190
In the development sections,
almost anything goes.

28
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.810
The theme can be varied.

29
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.420
It can be taken apart,
decomposed, if you will.

30
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.980
It can be reassembled in
imaginative sorts of ways.

31
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:07.000
Generally speaking with regard to texture,
we'll have more polyphony

32
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.470
than anything else in the development
section as the music is heard, and

33
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.810
heard against itself in imitations.

34
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.905
And it frequently moves through many
different keys by means of modulation.

35
00:02:17.905 --> 00:02:23.140
Ultimately, as you can see almost in
the middle of our diagram there, and

36
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.470
I suppose we should point out in passing
that it's in this middle of the diagram,

37
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.970
in the middle of the development section,

38
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.860
that most of the most intense
tension is experienced.

39
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.690
But that gradually resolves itself
into this portion of the form called

40
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.180
the retransition,
which leads us back to the recapitulation.

41
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.590
Now the recapitulation is
a very simple concept.

42
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.330
We come back to the tonic key.

43
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.850
We come back to the first theme.

44
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:50.710
So we're back home.

45
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.710
Home, away, home and thereafter
the themes return in the same sequence

46
00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:01.420
as they did in the exposition except
now the key remains in the tonic key.

47
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:08.740
As you can see also, there are two
optional parts of sonata-allegro form.

48
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:09.930
There's an introduction.

49
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.030
And generally speaking,
introductions are slow.

50
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.390
They sort of give us a question,
in essence.

51
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.400
We have a slow introduction
with puzzling chords.

52
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.460
Where is this going?

53
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.230
This mysterious loop beginning.

54
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.470
What sort of journey am I,
the listener, going to pursue?

55
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.620
How will all this play out?

56
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.430
And the second optional part is the coda.

57
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.820
Now the word comes from Italian, tail.

58
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.229
Codas can be long or short.

59
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.800
Beethoven liked to write long codas
because he liked to continue to vary

60
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.980
the material there.

61
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.180
Mozart tended to write shorter ones.

62
00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:56.780
But generally speaking, what a coda
does is throw out a harmonic anchor.

63
00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:03.900
It engages only very simple harmonic
progressions, usually just tonic dominant.

64
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.290
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum,
bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

65
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.140
As if to say we are at the end.

66
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.700
So this a general template.

67
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:20.690
It's a very useful template but almost no
piece follows sonata-allegro form exactly.

68
00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:26.220
This diagram is an ideal, but
let's hear a real example now.

69
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.160
The opening, the first movement
of Mozart's famous serenade.

70
00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.893
Eine kleine Nachtmusik, or A Little Night
Music, again the first movement, and

71
00:04:35.893 --> 00:04:38.853
of course it's written
in sonata-allegro form.

72
00:04:38.853 --> 00:04:39.712
All right.

73
00:04:39.712 --> 00:04:43.252
So let's listen to the first theme
of Mozart's Eine Kleine Nachtmusik.

74
00:04:43.252 --> 00:04:52.191
[MUSIC]

75
00:04:52.191 --> 00:04:54.036
A little syncopation there.

76
00:04:54.036 --> 00:05:03.672
[MUSIC]

77
00:05:03.672 --> 00:05:06.077
And it's sort of counterpoint to this so

78
00:05:06.077 --> 00:05:09.627
maybe we've got a couple little
ideas in here, A, B and C.

79
00:05:09.627 --> 00:05:15.398
[MUSIC]

80
00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:16.454
Agitation.

81
00:05:16.454 --> 00:05:17.766
Movement.

82
00:05:17.766 --> 00:05:24.753
[MUSIC]

83
00:05:24.753 --> 00:05:25.892
Here comes the bass.

84
00:05:25.892 --> 00:05:31.290
[MUSIC]

85
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:32.067
Pause.

86
00:05:32.067 --> 00:05:33.730
So we had a cadence there.

87
00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:34.710
De de de de.

88
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.740
That would be the end of
the musical phrase, a cadence, and

89
00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.360
the music actually stopped.

90
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.100
I like to think of this in
terms of almost a drama.

91
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.840
We've got a change of scene here,
there are some characters have gone off.

92
00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.940
The stage is now clear and
other characters are gonna come on.

93
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.650
So, what character is gonna come on?

94
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.280
Well a more lyrical second theme.

95
00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.986
I'm gonna play just a bit of it for you.

96
00:05:53.986 --> 00:06:00.047
[MUSIC]

97
00:06:00.047 --> 00:06:00.707
What about this?

98
00:06:00.707 --> 00:06:02.480
Is this a conjunct melody?

99
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.620
Obviously it's descending.

100
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:04.710
Conjunct or disjunct?

101
00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.750
Very conjunct.

102
00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.870
Actually, it's just
running down the scale.

103
00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.060
Now we don't have time because
this music is going by so fast.

104
00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.520
We've got our skippy opening
theme going around like that.

105
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.380
We don't have time to sort
of write down all those X's.

106
00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.849
So maybe just yeah.

107
00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:23.207
[MUSIC]

108
00:06:23.207 --> 00:06:25.807
And maybe something like that.

109
00:06:25.807 --> 00:06:27.804
So this is our first skippy theme.

110
00:06:27.804 --> 00:06:31.762
Our second theme, [SOUND],
has a nice sort of fall to it.

111
00:06:31.762 --> 00:06:33.201
Okay, here's the second theme.

112
00:06:33.201 --> 00:06:37.045
[MUSIC]

113
00:06:37.045 --> 00:06:37.904
Repeat.

114
00:06:37.904 --> 00:06:47.805
[MUSIC]

115
00:06:47.805 --> 00:06:49.965
Now, closing theme already.

116
00:06:49.965 --> 00:06:59.965
[MUSIC]

117
00:07:04.441 --> 00:07:06.055
Okay let's just pause it here for
a second.

118
00:07:06.055 --> 00:07:10.038
[MUSIC]

119
00:07:10.038 --> 00:07:13.102
What's the most noteworthy
aspect of that theme?

120
00:07:13.102 --> 00:07:16.874
[MUSIC]

121
00:07:16.874 --> 00:07:17.734
What do you think?

122
00:07:17.734 --> 00:07:20.300
What would you remember about that?

123
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.623
How would you graph that?

124
00:07:23.363 --> 00:07:24.061
Yeah.

125
00:07:24.061 --> 00:07:27.322
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> Okay, yeah, it starts out with

126
00:07:27.322 --> 00:07:28.936
[MUSIC]

127
00:07:28.936 --> 00:07:30.933
and then it's really conjunct, right?

128
00:07:30.933 --> 00:07:35.967
Because it's just staying on one pitch
level, sort of the ultimate conjunct

129
00:07:35.967 --> 00:07:41.350
joined to the point that it's a unison
pitch, da, ti, ti, ti, ti, ti.

130
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:43.760
So I'd remember that just like this idea.

131
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.580
So our closing theme, da, di,
di, di, da, da, turn, da, da, da,

132
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.380
da, almost the woodpecker idea, sorry.

133
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.440
But think of that kind of,
da, da, da, da, da, da.

134
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.540
Or maybe a machine gun, whatever sort of

135
00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:59.390
silly analogy you want to construct
to help you remember that.

136
00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:04.498
Okay, so here we are,
almost at the end of the exposition.

137
00:08:04.498 --> 00:08:07.956
Let's listen now to the end of
the exposition and then we'll stop.

138
00:08:07.956 --> 00:08:17.956
[MUSIC]

139
00:08:25.255 --> 00:08:26.393
Okay, so we're gonna stop there.

140
00:08:26.393 --> 00:08:29.800
Now, on this recording what do you think?

141
00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:34.820
Well, I think reasons for
time, let's go ahead and

142
00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:40.400
we'll advance it up to the beginning
of the development section.

143
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.910
So now we should listen to
this whole complex once again.

144
00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:46.500
We're not gonna do that,
we're gonna proceed here.

145
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.590
We're gonna go into
the development section and

146
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:54.046
it's kind of fun the way Mozart
starts the development section here.

147
00:08:54.046 --> 00:08:56.495
[MUSIC]

148
00:08:56.495 --> 00:08:58.261
Let me ask you this, we started here.

149
00:08:58.261 --> 00:09:01.697
[MUSIC]

150
00:09:01.697 --> 00:09:03.996
The development begins higher or lower?

151
00:09:03.996 --> 00:09:07.117
[MUSIC]

152
00:09:07.117 --> 00:09:07.999
Yeah?

153
00:09:07.999 --> 00:09:08.750
>> Lower.

154
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:11.680
>> Lower.
So, he's dropped down to the dominant.

155
00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.326
He's now in the dominant.

156
00:09:12.326 --> 00:09:15.287
[MUSIC]

157
00:09:15.287 --> 00:09:17.782
And if he continued as he had,

158
00:09:17.782 --> 00:09:20.428
[MUSIC]

159
00:09:20.428 --> 00:09:21.590
That's what he would have done.

160
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:22.843
That's not what he does, however.

161
00:09:22.843 --> 00:09:32.393
[MUSIC]

162
00:09:32.393 --> 00:09:33.311
He's sitting here.

163
00:09:33.311 --> 00:09:37.885
[MUSIC]

164
00:09:37.885 --> 00:09:39.046
And he ends up there.

165
00:09:39.046 --> 00:09:42.085
So we get this sort of dissonant shift,
and it's a signal.

166
00:09:42.085 --> 00:09:46.505
It's like the composer holding up a sign,
development, time for the development now.

167
00:09:46.505 --> 00:09:49.115
Okay.
So something, we've shifted.

168
00:09:49.115 --> 00:09:51.325
We were sort of slapped in the face,

169
00:09:51.325 --> 00:09:55.255
telling us we're at
a new point in our form.

170
00:09:55.255 --> 00:09:57.815
A new section in our form,
the development section.

171
00:09:57.815 --> 00:09:58.875
So as we listen to this,

172
00:09:58.875 --> 00:10:03.060
we'll hear Mozart move quickly
through some lots of different keys.

173
00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:04.690
I wouldn't be able to tell
you what keys they are.

174
00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:05.740
I really wouldn't.

175
00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:09.170
But I do know that he moves
through different keys.

176
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:12.050
Then we will hear a re-transition start.

177
00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:15.861
But here is my challenge to you, and why I
started putting all these things up here,

178
00:10:15.861 --> 00:10:18.120
which theme does he
choose to develop here?

179
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.100
Kind of interesting.

180
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.432
Does he go with the first theme?

181
00:10:20.432 --> 00:10:24.660
[SOUND] or the [SOUND] or

182
00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:30.136
the [SOUND], so which one?

183
00:10:30.136 --> 00:10:40.136
[MUSIC]

184
00:11:01.239 --> 00:11:02.517
Okay, stop it right there.

185
00:11:02.517 --> 00:11:05.460
Now he's all the way, first of all
what's the answer to the question?

186
00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:07.010
Which theme did he use here?

187
00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:10.747
We're now at the re-transition,
almost finished this short development,

188
00:11:10.747 --> 00:11:11.770
which one did he use?

189
00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:12.940
Who thinks they know?

190
00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.102
Raise your hand.

191
00:11:14.102 --> 00:11:15.332
Elizabeth?

192
00:11:15.332 --> 00:11:16.714
>> The closing theme.

193
00:11:16.714 --> 00:11:18.362
>> Used just the closing theme.

194
00:11:18.362 --> 00:11:24.851
[SOUND] So nothing but the closing theme
in this short Development section.

195
00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:26.499
Now we are at the re-transition.

196
00:11:26.499 --> 00:11:28.241
And you're going to hear
the violins come down.

197
00:11:28.241 --> 00:11:30.934
[MUSIC]

198
00:11:30.934 --> 00:11:33.711
But if I could sing a harmony,
maybe we should all sing it together,

199
00:11:33.711 --> 00:11:34.453
we'll be singing

200
00:11:34.453 --> 00:11:36.634
[MUSIC].

201
00:11:36.634 --> 00:11:38.133
It's the implied baseline.

202
00:11:38.133 --> 00:11:39.595
[MUSIC]

203
00:11:39.595 --> 00:11:41.453
And it's gonna go bum.

204
00:11:41.453 --> 00:11:42.497
Back to the tonic.

205
00:11:42.497 --> 00:11:46.620
And when it goes bum, then that first
theme is gonna come back in here.

206
00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:51.335
So let's listen to Mozart write
a retransition and I'm going to sing

207
00:11:51.335 --> 00:11:56.145
the implied or then sounded dominant
that's gonna lead to the tonic.

208
00:11:56.145 --> 00:12:06.145
[MUSIC]

209
00:12:17.424 --> 00:12:19.699
All the first theme material coming back.

210
00:12:19.699 --> 00:12:21.001
Nothing new.

211
00:12:21.001 --> 00:12:31.001
[MUSIC]

212
00:12:32.203 --> 00:12:34.479
There goes our bridge now movement.

213
00:12:34.479 --> 00:12:44.479
[MUSIC]

214
00:12:46.459 --> 00:12:47.968
And he just cut it short.

215
00:12:47.968 --> 00:12:49.580
The first time he went bum, bum bum bum.

216
00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:52.580
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum,
bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum,

217
00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:55.450
bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum,
bum, bum, bum, bum, is what the bass did.

218
00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:59.460
This time he just stops the thing and
stays in the tonic key.

219
00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:03.620
And then the rest of the material
will come back in in the proper order

220
00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:04.510
in the tonic key.

221
00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:07.930
All right we need not hear that,
let's go on now to the coda and

222
00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:11.440
we're just gonna listen generally
to what happens in a coda here.

223
00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.257
Typical coda with Mozart.

224
00:13:13.257 --> 00:13:23.257
[MUSIC]

225
00:13:24.658 --> 00:13:26.038
Tonic.

226
00:13:26.038 --> 00:13:27.641
Bum.

227
00:13:27.641 --> 00:13:30.694
Bum Bum.

228
00:13:30.694 --> 00:13:35.535
[MUSIC]

229
00:13:35.535 --> 00:13:37.636
It's almost stereotypical right?

230
00:13:37.636 --> 00:13:47.636
[MUSIC]

231
00:13:49.049 --> 00:13:49.838
You could have written that.

232
00:13:49.838 --> 00:13:51.290
Even I could have written that.

233
00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:52.339
Not so hard but

234
00:13:52.339 --> 00:13:58.140
as I say it's just a load of bricks
to bring this thing to a conclusion.

235
00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:03.210
That's a wonderful piece, so elegant,
so succinct, and so pleasing

236
00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:08.990
in the sense that it conforms to
sonata-allegro form in all particulars.

237
00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:11.890
Hooray!
It does exactly what our diagram,

238
00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:14.970
our model, says should happen.

239
00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:20.100
But here again we listeners can
experience the music in two ways,

240
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:23.020
for form and for emotion.

241
00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:25.930
We mustn't forget, as we focus on form,

242
00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:29.980
that the real message here is in
the emotional content of the music.

243
00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:36.680
Balance, elegance, grace, harmony,
these are just a few of the sensations

244
00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:40.400
that Mozart leaves with us
by the end of this movement.

245
00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.870
This piece is a staple at Starbucks.

246
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:45.758
It's popular, and for good reason.
