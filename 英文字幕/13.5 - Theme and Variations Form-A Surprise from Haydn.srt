00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.500
Introduction to Classical Music,
Session 13.5.

3
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.661
Theme and Variation Form,
A surprise From Haydn.

4
00:00:17.661 --> 00:00:21.486
>> We've already talked about how
Josef Haydn spent most of his

5
00:00:21.486 --> 00:00:26.740
professional life working in and around
Vienna for the wealthy Esterhazy family.

6
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.886
And how, while in semi-retirement he
went to London, where between 1791 and

7
00:00:31.886 --> 00:00:34.899
1795 he created and
performed his last, and

8
00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:39.180
most would say, his best symphonies,
the 12 London symphonies.

9
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.580
Actually, Haydn wasn't alone in this.

10
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:48.130
Mozart and Beethoven also had negotiations
with musical entrepreneurs in London,

11
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.740
to go to London.

12
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.020
But none of these actually
came to fruition.

13
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.670
But Haydn did go to London, and

14
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.970
as we have seen, his concer, concerts were
performed in the Hanover Square rooms.

15
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.480
And Haydn, like Mozart in Vienna,
sold tickets from his apartment.

16
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.320
Here we have, remarkably, a surviving
ticket from one of those concerts.

17
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.720
How many of you keep your concert tickets?

18
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.040
As you can see,

19
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.034
the concert was given in the Hanover
Square rooms on the 3rd of May, 1792.

20
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:27.830
The cost was a half guinea, which by my
rough calculation is about $60 of today.

21
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.080
But compared to good tickets of say,
the New York Philharmonic or

22
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.720
the Chicago Symphony Orchestra,
that's about the same, oddly.

23
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.570
I looked it up, and
the top ticket prices for

24
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.065
the New York Philharmonic
ranged from $65 to $118 each.

25
00:01:44.065 --> 00:01:48.250
Now if you wanted to buy a ticket in
London for one of Haydn's concerts,

26
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.750
you'd have to go to Haydn's house on
Great Street, which still exists.

27
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.680
Notice that this ticket was numbered 280,
and

28
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.040
that Haydn himself had signed it, as you
can see down there by the bottom right.

29
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.290
For some of these concerts,
he'd sold as many as 1,500 tickets.

30
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.030
One of the 12 symphonies
Haydn premiered in London

31
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.240
was his symphony number 94
called the Surprise Symphony.

32
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.990
Why?

33
00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.840
Because there is a surprise baked
inside the second slow movement of

34
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.030
this four movement symphony.

35
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.357
Let me play the theme on the keyboard.

36
00:02:27.357 --> 00:02:37.357
[MUSIC]

37
00:02:43.053 --> 00:02:45.340
Well just funning you there.

38
00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.163
[LAUGH] You know how it goes.

39
00:02:47.163 --> 00:02:51.655
[MUSIC]

40
00:02:51.655 --> 00:02:54.719
On the tonic.

41
00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:57.320
Then, it proceeds, this fashion.

42
00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:07.320
[MUSIC]

43
00:03:13.631 --> 00:03:15.964
So we have a very simple melody.

44
00:03:15.964 --> 00:03:17.252
It's triadic.

45
00:03:17.252 --> 00:03:18.263
It goes this way.

46
00:03:18.263 --> 00:03:20.167
[MUSIC]

47
00:03:20.167 --> 00:03:21.304
And then the dominant chord.

48
00:03:21.304 --> 00:03:26.992
[MUSIC]

49
00:03:26.992 --> 00:03:27.620
And then.

50
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.830
The crashing down
the chord in that fashion.

51
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.951
So we have a simple melody and then the
crashing dominant chord and because this

52
00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:43.709
is, this particular theme is binary, we
have the a section and then the b section.

53
00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:49.071
[MUSIC]

54
00:03:49.071 --> 00:03:50.990
Which we just played.

55
00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.430
So, two very simple ideas.

56
00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.200
So that's the theme that Haydn created.

57
00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.850
Very straightforward.

58
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:05.050
But very straightforward themes lend
themselves very well to theme and

59
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.520
variation's form.

60
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.340
The simpler the musical model, the more
you can dress it up as Hayden does here.

61
00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.440
But, the most famous moment of
this tune is that crashing chord.

62
00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.290
Why did Hayden do this?

63
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.901
Add this surprise chord at the beginning
of this, this lovely theme here.

64
00:04:24.901 --> 00:04:26.293
He did so, he tells us,

65
00:04:26.293 --> 00:04:31.750
in his memoirs, written in the last
year of his life, 1809, he did so.

66
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.230
So it was to execute, in effect,
to bring off a publicity stunt.

67
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:42.290
As he said, quote, to make a debut
in London in a brilliant manner.

68
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.510
So we're going to listen now, indeed,

69
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.150
we're going to watch
this surprising movement.

70
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.855
What you'll see is a collaboration
between Stephen Malinowski,

71
00:04:52.855 --> 00:04:56.060
a music animation machine and myself.

72
00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.550
Actually Steven does
most of the work here.

73
00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.670
He's the real brains behind the operation.

74
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:07.620
But I asked him to take this movement and
create visual symbols that made it easy

75
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:13.340
for us listeners to track
the whereabouts of the theme.

76
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.630
And alterations of that theme,

77
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.710
and add markers that allow us to see
where we are in the musical form.

78
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.090
Hope you like what we've created.

79
00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.500
Okay, so I've asked Stephen to, every
time the theme appears, the basic theme,

80
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.360
that's always going to
be color-coded in red.

81
00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.830
And you'll have different size
symbols indicate duration.

82
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.653
Starts very quietly.

83
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.390
texture, we have a melody and simple
chords in the bass parts underneath.

84
00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.687
Repeat, of course, and here we are.

85
00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:56.634
Binary form repeat of the a part.

86
00:05:56.634 --> 00:05:59.793
[MUSIC]

87
00:05:59.793 --> 00:06:04.089
You can see what's going to happen
where a bright light coming your way,.

88
00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:09.766
[MUSIC]

89
00:06:09.766 --> 00:06:14.595
Yeah, a binary form we go to the second
and final part the b section.

90
00:06:14.595 --> 00:06:21.004
[MUSIC]

91
00:06:21.004 --> 00:06:22.744
Melody in the violins.

92
00:06:22.744 --> 00:06:26.111
Now repeat.

93
00:06:26.111 --> 00:06:31.305
The repeat is varied, because as
you can see in the blue up above,

94
00:06:31.305 --> 00:06:33.390
we have woodwinds added.

95
00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:35.387
[MUSIC]

96
00:06:35.387 --> 00:06:38.451
Now they're playing in unison,
it's a violin.

97
00:06:38.451 --> 00:06:44.732
[MUSIC]

98
00:06:44.732 --> 00:06:46.102
First variation.

99
00:06:46.102 --> 00:06:48.982
[MUSIC]

100
00:06:48.982 --> 00:06:50.213
And it's a counter point.

101
00:06:50.213 --> 00:06:53.382
[MUSIC]

102
00:06:53.382 --> 00:06:55.924
Up above now it kind of
brings in the flute.

103
00:06:55.924 --> 00:07:00.103
[MUSIC]

104
00:07:00.103 --> 00:07:03.447
Now this is an exact replication
counter point violin.

105
00:07:03.447 --> 00:07:08.404
[MUSIC]

106
00:07:08.404 --> 00:07:11.190
Melody in the lower strings but
counterpoint.

107
00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:11.807
[MUSIC]

108
00:07:11.807 --> 00:07:13.350
in flutes.

109
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.009
Violin [INAUDIBLE].

110
00:07:15.009 --> 00:07:16.171
B section.

111
00:07:16.171 --> 00:07:18.482
[MUSIC]

112
00:07:18.482 --> 00:07:22.301
First violins play counterpoint,
second violins, melody.

113
00:07:22.301 --> 00:07:32.301
[MUSIC]

114
00:07:35.211 --> 00:07:39.425
B is repeated,

115
00:07:39.425 --> 00:07:45.264
[INAUDIBLE]
violins.

116
00:07:45.264 --> 00:07:49.885
[INAUDIBLE] And now, unison,
monophonic texture, everything together.

117
00:07:49.885 --> 00:07:54.087
And, of course, surprising.

118
00:07:54.087 --> 00:07:56.026
It's not in minor.

119
00:07:56.026 --> 00:07:57.988
A sudden harmonic shift.

120
00:07:57.988 --> 00:07:59.161
That was neat.

121
00:07:59.161 --> 00:08:02.307
[MUSIC]

122
00:08:02.307 --> 00:08:05.059
Now here's a again, now in the minor.

123
00:08:05.059 --> 00:08:10.746
[MUSIC]

124
00:08:10.746 --> 00:08:11.803
Harmonic again.

125
00:08:11.803 --> 00:08:18.119
[MUSIC]

126
00:08:18.119 --> 00:08:22.792
Now like development in the development
section of the symphony,

127
00:08:22.792 --> 00:08:27.631
it's not an allegro, it really has
a development section stuffed in

128
00:08:27.631 --> 00:08:30.483
the middle of this piece in binary form.

129
00:08:30.483 --> 00:08:31.923
[MUSIC]

130
00:08:31.923 --> 00:08:33.299
See how complex it is.

131
00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:38.895
[MUSIC]
Lot of things going on.

132
00:08:38.895 --> 00:08:45.332
Now this is close to a re-transition,
with the aim to simplify things,

133
00:08:45.332 --> 00:08:49.355
clear it out and
get you ready for something.

134
00:08:49.355 --> 00:08:51.177
And we're led back to.

135
00:08:51.177 --> 00:08:56.831
[MUSIC]

136
00:08:56.831 --> 00:09:01.209
Our a theme is the note
values being doubled.

137
00:09:01.209 --> 00:09:03.297
You can hear them up
there in the woodwinds.

138
00:09:03.297 --> 00:09:12.970
[MUSIC]

139
00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:16.533
A is repeated.

140
00:09:16.533 --> 00:09:21.432
Woodwinds alone here, at least
woodwinds being featured up above.

141
00:09:21.432 --> 00:09:23.614
The theme is quietly underneath.

142
00:09:23.614 --> 00:09:32.949
[MUSIC]

143
00:09:32.949 --> 00:09:36.520
New rewriting of b,

144
00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:42.828
melody sneaking up in the violins.

145
00:09:42.828 --> 00:09:48.087
[MUSIC]

146
00:09:48.087 --> 00:09:53.928
Same material, but now the texture
is enhanced by means of supporting

147
00:09:53.928 --> 00:09:59.975
accompaniment underneath, that you
see there in the green and yellow.

148
00:09:59.975 --> 00:10:03.447
[MUSIC]

149
00:10:03.447 --> 00:10:07.834
Okay, full texture here.

150
00:10:07.834 --> 00:10:11.622
Still homophonic texture but
notice how many parts we have playing but

151
00:10:11.622 --> 00:10:14.394
notice all the verticality,
indicating chords.

152
00:10:14.394 --> 00:10:15.812
Homophonic texture.

153
00:10:15.812 --> 00:10:24.285
[MUSIC]

154
00:10:24.285 --> 00:10:26.933
Now, part of the tune is all
the way down in the basses.

155
00:10:26.933 --> 00:10:36.933
[MUSIC]

156
00:10:40.644 --> 00:10:42.489
Simply playing with the b theme.

157
00:10:42.489 --> 00:10:49.723
[MUSIC]

158
00:10:49.723 --> 00:10:52.010
Well, we can see that something's
going to happen here.

159
00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:54.690
It's probably going to be loud and full.

160
00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:59.370
[MUSIC]

161
00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:00.646
Not much theme here.

162
00:11:00.646 --> 00:11:02.341
More fanfare than theme.

163
00:11:02.341 --> 00:11:11.222
Now the theme comes back [INAUDIBLE]
parts.

164
00:11:11.222 --> 00:11:15.228
Now a transition, again, as you would
have in the Sonata, Allegro Four.

165
00:11:15.228 --> 00:11:21.045
It's just heading to a point of stasis,
rival.

166
00:11:21.045 --> 00:11:24.864
But with a rival like that,
it's unstable, it wants to go somewhere.

167
00:11:24.864 --> 00:11:27.150
[MUSIC]

168
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:32.282
It goes back to just snippets of
our theme in the form of a coda.

169
00:11:32.282 --> 00:11:33.605
[MUSIC]

170
00:11:33.605 --> 00:11:36.542
Reminiscences of our theme.

171
00:11:36.542 --> 00:11:43.845
Notice here, all, all, all tonic.

172
00:11:43.845 --> 00:11:45.203
Whoops, haven't quite got there yet.

173
00:11:45.203 --> 00:11:47.862
Here we go with all tonic.

174
00:11:47.862 --> 00:11:49.068
Here's all tonic.

175
00:11:49.068 --> 00:11:57.265
[MUSIC]

176
00:11:57.265 --> 00:11:58.985
Wow, very instructive.
