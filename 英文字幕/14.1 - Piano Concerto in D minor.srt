00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:10.025
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:35.540
In case you haven't noticed,
among the classical composers,

3
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.008
my favorite is Mozart.

4
00:00:37.008 --> 00:00:42.225
Admittedly, Beethoven powerfully
affects me, as he does almost everyone,

5
00:00:42.225 --> 00:00:46.423
but to me Mozart is special,
as a composer and as a human being.

6
00:00:46.423 --> 00:00:52.053
So that's why I've chosen to devote this
session to three classical masterpieces,

7
00:00:52.053 --> 00:00:53.080
all by Mozart.

8
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.023
Why Mozart, what's special about Mozart?

9
00:00:57.023 --> 00:00:59.612
What makes his music extraordinary?

10
00:00:59.612 --> 00:01:01.212
Well we'll talk about that,

11
00:01:01.212 --> 00:01:05.510
we'll even conclude with that by way of
a review at the end of today's session.

12
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.876
But having decided that Mozart alone is
worthy of an entire session in our course,

13
00:01:11.876 --> 00:01:13.401
which Mozart to choose?

14
00:01:13.401 --> 00:01:18.541
Well of course I said to myself Craig,
what are your favorites?

15
00:01:18.541 --> 00:01:22.550
So, I mulled that over for a while,
and distilled the list to three.

16
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.780
The D Minor Piano Concerto, the opera
Don Giovanni, although Figaro is oh,

17
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.730
oh, oh so good, and
finally, the Requiem Mass.

18
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.066
And then I realized something,
hey, you know what?

19
00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:38.912
All three of these works
are in a minor key, indeed,

20
00:01:38.912 --> 00:01:41.197
they are in the same minor key.

21
00:01:41.197 --> 00:01:46.019
Now even in Mozart's day,
all keys did not sound exactly the same,

22
00:01:46.019 --> 00:01:50.440
ee hadn't quite arrived yet
at equal temperament.

23
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.210
C minor had a slightly different
sound to it than D minor,

24
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.240
which had a slightly different
feeling to it than E minor, and so on.

25
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.860
Again, this had to do with the way
instruments were tuned in Mozart's day.

26
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.410
So all these pieces do have
a particular character to them.

27
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.038
They're not only in minor, which has
a somber feeling to it already, but

28
00:02:10.038 --> 00:02:14.440
in D minor, which was for Mozart,
was the demonic key, a key of evil,

29
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.503
the key of Hell.

30
00:02:15.503 --> 00:02:19.996
So today, we're going to visit
through our three masterpieces,

31
00:02:19.996 --> 00:02:21.692
the dark side of Mozart.

32
00:02:21.692 --> 00:02:26.080
Our first piece is the piano
concerto in D minor, K466.

33
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.060
Now, remember K with Mozart
just stands for Kochel.

34
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.310
In 19th century, musicologists who
compiled this lists of pieces by Mozart in

35
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.349
chronological order,
K.466 dates from early 1785.

36
00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.900
And don't forget that during the classical
period, the concerto grosso, a type of

37
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.890
concerto featuring a number of soloists,
we saw one by Vivaldi and one by Bach.

38
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.000
The concerto grosso is generally
replaced by the solo concerto,

39
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.170
a genre in which a single soloist
played harmoniously with, and

40
00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.000
in competition against,
the full orchestra.

41
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:07.330
Mozart composed the D Minor Piano
Concerto, one of the 23 that he wrote,

42
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.590
for a series of concerts that he
was giving at the casino in Vienna.

43
00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.840
Now you remember the casino,
here's Canaletto's painting of it,

44
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.360
at the blue arrow there, and
here's the inside again.

45
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.060
Remember, it was Mozart's job to organize
the concert, round up the performers,

46
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.822
conduct, sell tickets, service soloists,

47
00:03:26.822 --> 00:03:31.020
have the piano forte brought over
there to the casino, everything.

48
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.470
The audience consisted,
really of only about 150 to 200, but

49
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.530
they were mostly aristocrats, so Mozart
could charge high prices, which he did.

50
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.800
At one concert alone
earlier on in his career,

51
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.310
he made four times his
father's annual salary.

52
00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:52.210
In other words, he made about $120,000
in money of today, in just one night.

53
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.160
Actually, Mozart's father,
a stern looking Leopold that we see here.

54
00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.550
Leopold Mozart happened to be in
town that February of 1785, and

55
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:07.020
he came to this concert in the casino, and
heard the piece that we're about to hear.

56
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.100
And he described it as, quote,
a new and very fine concerto.

57
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.320
So new in fact, that there wasn't
time to rehearse the finale.

58
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.010
The last of the three movements
the orchestra just had to sight read

59
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.990
the finale,
just wing it at the performance.

60
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.540
Mozart himself conducted the concert,
but conducted seated at the pianoforte,

61
00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.050
which he of course played
as soloist in the concerto.

62
00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.140
We'll listen to a performance
of this in a moment, but

63
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.840
first, this next slide makes
a couple of important points.

64
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.955
Notice first, the woman as soloist.

65
00:04:44.955 --> 00:04:49.415
There were a number of female
keyboard virtuosos in Mozart's day,

66
00:04:49.415 --> 00:04:53.375
maybe we should call them,
more correctly, virtuosas.

67
00:04:53.375 --> 00:04:57.835
Mozart taught one of them, Barbara Ployer,
and he knew another one Victoire Jenamy,

68
00:04:57.835 --> 00:05:00.675
and he wrote concertos for
both of these women.

69
00:05:00.675 --> 00:05:07.920
So seeing a female keyboard virtuosa,
in this day, wasn't in any way unusual.

70
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.680
Notice also that the lid is taken
off entirely from the instrument,

71
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.735
that's simply for better resonance.

72
00:05:14.735 --> 00:05:18.280
Notice also, that people are talking
while the performance is going on, and

73
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.630
that a dog is walking around the room.

74
00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:25.870
Music here again isn't so
much art as it is, music as entertainment.

75
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.840
Now let's take a look at a slide
of Mozart's own piano, and

76
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.559
I hope you can appreciate from this photo
taken in the Geburtshaus in Salzburg,

77
00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:40.430
that this instrument, as with all
pianos of this day, was very small.

78
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:47.440
Mozart's piano had only 61 keys on it,
not the 88 of today's keyboard.

79
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:54.710
It weighed exactly 187 pounds, not the
1200 pounds of our modern concert grand.

80
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.730
This again is not a replica
of Mozart's piano,

81
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.050
it is in fact Mozart's actual piano.

82
00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.800
Which brings us to an interesting point,
which would you rather hear,

83
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.240
Mozart's music played on Mozart's piano,
or Mozart's music played on a big,

84
00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.720
powerful, modern grand piano?

85
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.960
We'll give you a chance to
choose here in just a minute.

86
00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:22.460
To do so, let's turn to a performance
by pianist Steven Lubin.

87
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.389
[MUSIC]

88
00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:29.098
Now he's playing on a replica
of Mozart piano, and

89
00:06:29.098 --> 00:06:32.929
you can see that his
touch is very light and

90
00:06:32.929 --> 00:06:36.981
that the keyboard sound is rather smaller,

91
00:06:36.981 --> 00:06:40.613
light keyboard action, light sound.

92
00:06:40.613 --> 00:06:44.050
[MUSIC]

93
00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:50.911
Mozart's music, Mozart's instrument,
rewards fast and light playing.

94
00:06:50.911 --> 00:06:56.040
[MUSIC]

95
00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.757
Of course variations of Twinkle,
Twinkle Little Star.

96
00:06:58.757 --> 00:07:08.757
[MUSIC]

97
00:07:18.555 --> 00:07:22.955
Okay, that's probably enough of that.

98
00:07:22.955 --> 00:07:26.115
We're about to hear Mozart
on a modern grand piano, but

99
00:07:26.115 --> 00:07:31.250
before we do, let's think about the piano
concerto as Mozart conceived it.

100
00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:36.130
Just as Haydn was more or less the
inventor of the modern string quartet, so

101
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:38.850
Mozart was the father
of the piano concerto.

102
00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:42.856
He set out the structural
framework of the piano concerto,

103
00:07:42.856 --> 00:07:46.313
one that lasted into the romantic era,
here it is.

104
00:07:46.313 --> 00:07:51.089
Mozart developed a stereotypical approach
to the first movement of the concerto.

105
00:07:51.089 --> 00:07:54.419
It goes by several names, concerto form,

106
00:07:54.419 --> 00:07:58.217
double exposition form
Are the two most common.

107
00:07:58.217 --> 00:08:00.685
Double exposition form is a good name for

108
00:08:00.685 --> 00:08:05.310
this form because there are as
you can see, two expositions.

109
00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:10.080
We have one exposition as we had in
sonata-allegro form development,

110
00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:10.890
recapitulation.

111
00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:15.750
But now we have another exposition
added at the beginning.

112
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:22.370
The first exposition allows the orchestra
to present most of the themes by itself.

113
00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:29.690
The pianist will add a couple later on,
and do so all in the tonic key.

114
00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:34.540
Let's listen now to a performance of
this concerto where we played in a large

115
00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:39.460
concert grand by Mitsuko Uchida, and
I'll talk through this as we go along.

116
00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:44.492
You can see here the concert
hall the Mozarteum in Salzburg.

117
00:08:44.492 --> 00:08:48.461
It seats about 1,000.

118
00:08:48.461 --> 00:08:50.980
Here is Mitsuko Uchida.

119
00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:55.338
>> [APPLAUSE]
>> Notice that she, too,

120
00:08:55.338 --> 00:08:58.600
has taken the lid off the instrument.

121
00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.690
But it is, of course,
a modern grand piano.

122
00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:03.940
And it amuses me to see,

123
00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:08.920
as you'll see a little bit closer here in
a moment, it is actually a Steinway grand.

124
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:12.550
So here's the first movement.

125
00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:19.759
And as in Mozart's day,
she will rise and conduct.

126
00:09:23.533 --> 00:09:26.237
[MUSIC]

127
00:09:26.237 --> 00:09:32.193
Right off the bat you can notice the dark,
somber, almost ominous sound.

128
00:09:32.193 --> 00:09:34.213
[MUSIC]

129
00:09:34.213 --> 00:09:38.113
That's a D minor featuring
the low strings.

130
00:09:38.113 --> 00:09:47.168
[MUSIC]

131
00:09:47.168 --> 00:09:48.398
Obviously, woodwinds.

132
00:09:48.398 --> 00:09:55.317
[MUSIC]

133
00:09:55.317 --> 00:09:59.229
She's not so
much beating a beat pattern, but

134
00:09:59.229 --> 00:10:02.852
simply moding the music to the orchestra.

135
00:10:02.852 --> 00:10:06.590
And we're coming to the end,
the transition here in just a second.

136
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:10.897
[MUSIC]

137
00:10:10.897 --> 00:10:12.128
It's gonna turn dark again.

138
00:10:12.128 --> 00:10:13.312
[MUSIC]

139
00:10:13.312 --> 00:10:14.473
Timpani.

140
00:10:14.473 --> 00:10:18.814
[MUSIC]

141
00:10:18.814 --> 00:10:21.647
End of transition.

142
00:10:21.647 --> 00:10:23.713
Second theme.

143
00:10:23.713 --> 00:10:25.629
Contrasting, lighter, more tender.

144
00:10:25.629 --> 00:10:27.266
[MUSIC]

145
00:10:27.266 --> 00:10:30.528
It rises up, melodic sequence,
step by step.

146
00:10:30.528 --> 00:10:34.626
Easy way to remember that particular tune.

147
00:10:34.626 --> 00:10:42.752
[MUSIC]

148
00:10:42.752 --> 00:10:44.064
Now they're gonna charge to C.

149
00:10:44.064 --> 00:10:54.064
[MUSIC]

150
00:11:02.592 --> 00:11:04.183
So he's got a motive that's going down.

151
00:11:04.183 --> 00:11:08.989
[MUSIC]

152
00:11:08.989 --> 00:11:09.987
Comes up the scale.

153
00:11:09.987 --> 00:11:12.622
[MUSIC]

154
00:11:12.622 --> 00:11:17.290
And watch, he's gonna turn that motive
back the other way in just a second.

155
00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:21.770
[MUSIC]

156
00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:23.384
Watch this.

157
00:11:23.384 --> 00:11:25.125
[MUSIC]

158
00:11:25.125 --> 00:11:26.321
Small point, but really cool.

159
00:11:26.321 --> 00:11:27.180
Okay, and

160
00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:33.206
now just the little closing theme at
the end of the orchestral exposition.

161
00:11:33.206 --> 00:11:36.108
[MUSIC]

162
00:11:36.108 --> 00:11:38.788
[INAUDIBLE] blissful,
nostalgic, reminiscent.

163
00:11:38.788 --> 00:11:41.703
[MUSIC]

164
00:11:41.703 --> 00:11:43.026
And the D minor.

165
00:11:43.026 --> 00:11:45.139
And the pianist comes in at this point.

166
00:11:45.139 --> 00:11:49.150
She sits down,
no longer the conductor, but pianist.

167
00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:53.280
All right, that gets us into
the second exposition here.

168
00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.197
Let's pause for a moment.

169
00:11:55.197 --> 00:11:58.157
[MUSIC]

170
00:11:58.157 --> 00:12:00.300
So what did you think
about those two pianos?

171
00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:01.920
Which would you prefer to hear?

172
00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:07.090
Mozart's piece on the original Mozart
piano or Mozart's piece on a modern grand?

173
00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:09.910
Which would Mozart have preferred?

174
00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:15.380
Well I'd submit that he'd actually
preferred the modern grand because

175
00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:21.100
Mozart loved when technology
could enhance musical sound.

176
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.380
A new and better clarinet for example,
which is what he experienced in Monheim in

177
00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:31.130
1777, or the re-orchestrations that he
did of the oratorios of Hendel, including

178
00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:35.875
Messiah, in order to take advantage of
the newest and best in sound capabilities.

179
00:12:35.875 --> 00:12:39.131
Adding trumpets and drums and
other instruments to Messiah.

180
00:12:39.131 --> 00:12:43.280
So I think Mozart would have
been very much pleased with

181
00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:46.790
the sound of a larger orchestra and
the bigger piano.

182
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:51.720
But back now to our D
minor piano concerto.

183
00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:55.730
We're now going to skip to the end of
the recapitulation where we'll hear again

184
00:12:55.730 --> 00:13:01.050
Mozart's themes, but as we do so
he presents then in a varied fashion.

185
00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:03.970
With ornamentation,
ornamentation that places more and

186
00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:08.100
more technical demand on the pianist.

187
00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:11.105
Watch how difficult it gets as
we drive toward the cadenza.

188
00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:16.220
Now remember, a cadenza,
as we saw with Bach, is a showy passage

189
00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:20.670
in which the soloist gets to demonstrate
his or her technical skills.

190
00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:25.130
And reminisce a bit,
improvise a bit, riff on a bit,

191
00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:29.280
the themes that have occurred
previously in a movement.

192
00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:34.300
But here, the cadenza that you'll hear
is not by Mozart, but by Beethoven.

193
00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.370
Why?

194
00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:40.000
What's a cadenza by Beethoven doing in
the middle of a concerto by Mozart?

195
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.390
Well, Mozart rarely left
us any cadenzas for

196
00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:47.690
the concertos that he
himself performed in public.

197
00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:49.250
Again, why?

198
00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:54.040
Well Mozart would need to write
down all the orchestral parts.

199
00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:59.380
Stuff that others would need to know to be
able to play the piece, but Mozart didn't

200
00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:04.400
need to write down what he had to play
because he already had it in his head.

201
00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:09.010
And if he'd wrote it down someone
might steal his flashy cadenza.

202
00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:11.340
Mozart thought about things like that.

203
00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.450
So Mozart just sat there at the piano and

204
00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:16.422
improvised like a jazz
performer might today.

205
00:14:16.422 --> 00:14:19.970
Surely he never did it the same way twice.

206
00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:24.720
And for this reason, we have no cadenza
here by Mozart from Mozart's own concerto.

207
00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.320
However we do have one from Beethoven for

208
00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:31.590
this piece because Beethoven also
played this concerto by Mozart and he,

209
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:36.210
Beethoven, has left us a cadenza
from the classical period.

210
00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:41.642
So let's return to the end of
the recapitulation in our concerto and

211
00:14:41.642 --> 00:14:43.554
push on to the cadenza.

212

219
00:15:31.313 --> 00:15:35.376
That two note motive he's hammering home.

220
00:15:35.376 --> 00:15:37.291
Dramatic rise.

221
00:15:37.291 --> 00:15:39.532
Scalar rise from the left hand.

[MUSIC]

225
00:15:50.383 --> 00:15:54.533
Descending, arpeggio,
trill indicating [INAUDIBLE] end.

226
00:15:54.533 --> 00:16:01.170
This section,
there's a hint of that first theme again,

227
00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:08.348
and now we're going to end on
a chord that suspends the action,

228
00:16:08.348 --> 00:16:15.401
and we want to hear more with
that suspenseful, in comes the.

229
00:16:15.401 --> 00:16:17.699
[MUSIC]

230
00:16:17.699 --> 00:16:21.900
Credenza, but again by Mozart,
excuse me, but again by Beethoven.

231
00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:30.678
[MUSIC]

232
00:16:30.678 --> 00:16:36.478
Beethoven.
[MUSIC]

233
00:16:36.478 --> 00:16:40.776
[INAUDIBLE] understood exactly how
Mozart [INAUDIBLE] continued this,

234
00:16:40.776 --> 00:16:42.095
but he didn't care.

235
00:16:42.095 --> 00:16:44.325
This is Beethoven,
Beethoven pounding away.

236
00:16:44.325 --> 00:16:49.715
Mozart wouldn't have pounded a reiterated
sequence of pitches quite like that.

237
00:16:49.715 --> 00:16:53.255
So here's bringing back a new
theme that he introduced.

238
00:16:53.255 --> 00:17:00.503
[MUSIC]

239
00:17:00.503 --> 00:17:02.610
Taking it up to a higher pitch level.

[MUSIC]

241
00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:28.762
So this is what we mean by simply playing
with themes, further developing themes.

242
00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:35.120
So you're in the cadenza.

243
00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:38.384
Hint of the ominous first theme.

244
00:17:38.384 --> 00:17:42.282
Rises up by step.

245
00:17:42.282 --> 00:17:48.405
[MUSIC]

246
00:17:48.405 --> 00:17:55.201
There's that new theme again.

00:17:55.201 --> 00:18:05.201
[MUSIC]

248
00:18:10.417 --> 00:18:16.099
When you hear a trill in music,
about to hear one in a moment.

249
00:18:16.099 --> 00:18:20.015
You know that that's like holding up
a sign for the rest of the performers.

250
00:18:20.015 --> 00:18:24.043
Hey, pick up your instruments, get ready,

251
00:18:24.043 --> 00:18:27.650
cuz you've gotta come back in and play.

252
00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:32.000
So here's the pick up your instruments
signal, and there they go.

253
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:39.936
[MUSIC]

254
00:18:39.936 --> 00:18:41.010

256
00:18:43.558 --> 00:18:45.805

258
00:18:49.595 --> 00:18:54.363

[MUSIC]

268
00:19:40.792 --> 00:19:45.535
Well I hope you'll share with me my
beliefs that this is an extraordinary

269
00:19:45.535 --> 00:19:50.121
movement, and how different from
the ethos or the feeling of a Baroque

270
00:19:50.121 --> 00:19:54.630
concerto of the sort that we
experienced with Bach and Vivaldi.

271
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:58.460
Baroque concertos usually just
have one mood for a movement.

272
00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:02.050
Mozart is full of many different moods.

273
00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:06.780
And that helps make these classical
movements very exciting, very dramatic.

274
00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:12.060
And with its D minor sound,
it's almost demonic.

275
00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:14.770
You can watch the rest of
this by going to YouTube.

276
00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:15.920
But before we do so,

277
00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:21.840
let's review our Mozart concerto by
revisiting these particular points.

278
00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:26.750
Kochel number, well we talked about
that before, almost ad nauseum here.

279
00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:28.680
A catalog of Mozart's works.

280
00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:33.470
Solo concerto, obviously we've moved
away here in the classical period from

281
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:40.080
the predominant tradition of concerto
grosso to the solo concerto.

282
00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:43.770
The most commonly experienced solo
concerto is the piano concerto.

283
00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:46.550
We get our word piano, of course,

284
00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:51.440
from the term pianoforte around 1770,
particularly with Mozart,

285
00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:56.820
the pianoforte began to replace
the harpsichord and eventually the second

286
00:20:56.820 --> 00:21:01.680
half of that term pianoforte was dropped
leaving us with the expression piano.

287
00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.715
We talked about the double
exposition form,

288
00:21:03.715 --> 00:21:05.990
it's something particular to concerto.

289
00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:09.760
We can also call this concerto form but
there are two expositions here.

290
00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:15.080
One for the orchestra and then one for
the soloist accompanied by the orchestra.

291
00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:21.732
And finally the idea of the cadenza,
which is simply a fast,

292
00:21:21.732 --> 00:21:26.689
flashy passage toward
the end of the movement

293
00:21:26.689 --> 00:21:31.645
that gives the soloist,
whether him or her,

294
00:21:31.645 --> 00:21:38.579
the opportunity to showcase his or
her technical virtuosity.
