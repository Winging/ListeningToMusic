2
00:00:17.215 --> 00:00:21.710
Mozart is often called the most
universal of all composers.

3
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.300
That's the way the Oxford Dictionary music
opens it's definitive article on Mozart.

4
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.990
And he is universal, of course, because
he wrote in all genres, including opera.

5
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.216
Most composers were either or
composers, in the sense that they

6
00:00:38.216 --> 00:00:43.800
were either great instrumental
composers or great opera composer.

7
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.140
Wagner, Verdi, Puccini, almost nothing but
operas, Bach, Beethoven, Haydn.

8
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.948
Well, Bach wrote no operas,
Beethoven, one.

9
00:00:52.948 --> 00:00:58.960
Haydn wrote many but he didn't have
the success of those of Mozart.

10
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.110
And I'm embarrassed to say I
couldn't even identify it for you.

11
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.185
I'd be hard pressed to name
a single opera by Haydn.

12
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.970
But Mozart was a spectacular opera
composer, certainly among the two or

13
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.400
three best ever.

14
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.640
Maybe the best.

15
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.870
Composing opera was
Mozart's favorite activity.

16
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.750
That's what he lived for.

17
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.635
What operas did he write?

18
00:01:22.635 --> 00:01:26.440
Well, he wrote his first
remarkably enough at age 12.

19
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.110
Thereafter, he wrote many opera Serail,
these large and

20
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.650
imposing and somewhat static operas of
the Baroque early classical period.

21
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.280
Then he turned to comic opera or
a blend of comic opera and

22
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.630
serious in a new combination style
opera that Mozart himself created.

23
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.400
We'll see this half-serious half-comic
style in Mozart's Don Giovanni.

24
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:58.250
Mozart's three greatest
operas are these three.

25
00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.950
Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni, and

26
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.440
the Magic Flute,
which is the greatest opera every written?

27
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.550
Well maybe Figaro or maybe Don Giovanni or
possibly the Magic Flute.

28
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.250
Now, the Marriage of Figaro and

29
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.275
Don Giovanni have something in common,
a theater.

30
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.230
Figaro, as we said,
was premiered here at the Burgtheater.

31
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.330
Now here's another view
of that same theater.

32
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.210
Figaro was a success here so
Mozart received and

33
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.250
accepted an invitation to go to Prague
to have Figaro performed there.

34
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.190
So Mozart made the two day
coach journey as you can see

35
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.090
up from Vienna to
the beautiful city of Prague.

36
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.790
Now, Prague fortunately has escaped
bombing during the Second World War,

37
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.110
so its architecture is
remarkably well preserved.

38
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.824
Here's the Estates Theater in the center
of the city, constructed in 1783.

39
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.950
The Estates Theater in Prague was
where Mozart's Figaro was performed.

40
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.580
Figaro was so popular in Prague that
Mozart was asked to compose a new opera

41
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.000
for the city, which he did, Don Giovanni,
and which was premiered here

42
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.840
in October of 1787, again in this theater.

43
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.310
You can see that when I was there,
Don Giovanni was actually playing.

44
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.380
So needless to say,
I didn't miss that chance.

45
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.070
And I went and took a few pictures.

46
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.270
It was in this theater inside
of which you see here of course.

47
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:37.262
It was in this theater that all the opera
scenes for the film Amadeus were created.

48
00:03:37.262 --> 00:03:42.390
Amadeus was filmed in Prague
because there was, and as we said,

49
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.820
more authentic architecture here in
Prague than there was and is in Vienna.

50
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:56.446
Let's watch a scene now from Amadeus that
we can see Mozart's theater in action.

51
00:03:56.446 --> 00:04:01.183
>> It was terrifying and
wonderful to watch.

52
00:04:01.183 --> 00:04:02.373
[MUSIC]

53
00:04:02.373 --> 00:04:08.498
>> So this of course is
the personification of Antonio Salieri,

54
00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:11.810
Mozart's proposed archenemy.

55
00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.081
Here's Mozart conducting
Don Giovanni in this theater.

56
00:04:17.081 --> 00:04:23.091
It still exists, and they tried to make
it as close to the original as possible.

57
00:04:23.091 --> 00:04:25.593
[MUSIC]

58
00:04:25.593 --> 00:04:29.437
What we're watching is the Return of

59
00:04:29.437 --> 00:04:34.894
the Commendatore to exact
revenge on Don Giovanni,

60
00:04:34.894 --> 00:04:39.243
it's terrifying music all in D-minor.

61
00:04:39.243 --> 00:04:42.780
[MUSIC]

62
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.661
It's Leporello who we'll meet in a moment.

63
00:04:45.661 --> 00:04:49.369
[MUSIC]

64
00:04:49.369 --> 00:04:50.586
Leporello under the table.

65
00:04:50.586 --> 00:04:57.175
[MUSIC]

66
00:04:57.175 --> 00:05:00.240
Don Giovanni in front of him now.

67
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.600
Okay, I cut it off there, aha.

68
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.940
Did it on purpose,
leaving you to want more.

69
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:07.690
And we'll get to that.

70
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.390
But to the beginning of this opera,
Don Giovanni, what's it about?

71
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:13.930
Well let's review.

72
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.170
What's opera about?

73
00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.530
Mozart wrote three great operas.

74
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.410
Marriage of Figaro,
Don Giovanni, The Magic Flute.

75
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:28.520
And we're now gonna segue over
to the discussion of opera.

76
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.460
What's opera?

77
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.560
Musically heightened drama.

78
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.890
Music is there behind the drama,
and it reinforces it.

79
00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.750
It does the same thing in film.

80
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.820
Ever think about horror films?

81
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.802
What's the scariest horror
film you've ever seen?

82
00:05:42.802 --> 00:05:43.818
AJ?

83
00:05:47.154 --> 00:05:48.118
Chucky?

84
00:05:48.118 --> 00:05:49.880
>> [LAUGH]
>> Okay.

85
00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.010
There's one I don't know about.

86
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.140
But, Shining, something like that,
I don't know.

87
00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.040
Think of something.

88
00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.160
I don't get scared when watching
a movie until what happens?

89
00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.870
I see some really scary visual.

90
00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.000
Come on.

91
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.620
What scares you in movies.

92
00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.620
Supposing they took the sound,
the sound track out of these horror films.

93
00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.570
You wouldn't be frightened at all.

94
00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.370
I think we have a much more visceral
response to sound than we do to

95
00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:15.960
visual images.

96
00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.860
And that's what's going
on globally in opera.

97
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.920
And opera, as you know, is made up of
an introductory overture, and then these

98
00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:28.600
numbers, such as recitatives, where
the composer tells you what's going on.

99
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:33.744
You remember the Bugs Bunny, or
I guess it's Warner Brothers cartoon,

100
00:06:33.744 --> 00:06:38.651
[SOUND] be very quiet, I am hunting
rabbit, [SOUND] that kind of thing?

101
00:06:38.651 --> 00:06:42.700
So that's a recitative, what's going on.

102
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:47.980
Then somebody will come out and sing about
how they felt about what just happened.

103
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.320
That's what goes on in an aria.

104
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:55.544
And arias will tend to repeat words and on
and on it goes to give a sense of emotion.

105
00:06:55.544 --> 00:06:58.842
And there are choruses involved
in it from time to time too.

106
00:06:58.842 --> 00:07:03.246
Now as we mentioned Mozart wrote
three wonderful operas two of them

107
00:07:03.246 --> 00:07:05.300
by Labredus Lorenzo Da Ponte.

108
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.853
Read in your textbook there's
a box on Lorenzo Da Ponte.

109
00:07:07.853 --> 00:07:12.411
Absolutely fascinating life far more
fascinating than fiction could ever

110
00:07:12.411 --> 00:07:12.997
make it.

111
00:07:12.997 --> 00:07:18.075
But we're going to talk
now about Don Giovanni.

112
00:07:18.075 --> 00:07:20.144
What music is this?

113
00:07:20.144 --> 00:07:22.928
Linda, could we have
the next piece of music?

114
00:07:22.928 --> 00:07:32.928
[MUSIC]

115
00:07:37.947 --> 00:07:39.527
What's that?

116
00:07:39.527 --> 00:07:42.632
Nice and loud,
somebody's got it out there.

117
00:07:42.632 --> 00:07:44.141
Overture to Don Giovanni.

118
00:07:44.141 --> 00:07:46.260
Overture to Don Giovanni.

119
00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:50.898
Mozart wrote them right here
at this estate outside of

120
00:07:50.898 --> 00:07:55.236
Prague in the wee hours 28 October, 1787.

121
00:07:55.236 --> 00:07:59.209
He wrote the whole thing right here
at this estate between midnight and

122
00:07:59.209 --> 00:08:00.701
7:00 in the morning.

123
00:08:00.701 --> 00:08:03.118
An extraordinary creative act.

124
00:08:03.118 --> 00:08:05.618
Act of procrastination, I suppose.

125
00:08:05.618 --> 00:08:08.970
An act of self confidence
that he could get it done.

126
00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:13.950
It's this overture that opens the opera,
of course, Don Giovanni,

127
00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:17.680
and it was turned into something of
a signature tune for the film Amadeus.

128
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.436
Let's take a listen here.

129
00:08:19.436 --> 00:08:21.857
[MUSIC]

130
00:08:21.857 --> 00:08:25.863
This can be very scary because
of the D minor tonality,

131
00:08:25.863 --> 00:08:28.835
sudden fortissimo, and minor chords.

132
00:08:28.835 --> 00:08:31.716
There's a major dominant chord,

133
00:08:31.716 --> 00:08:36.694
which he'll come back to that
tonic minor in just a second.

134
00:08:36.694 --> 00:08:42.391
[MUSIC]

135
00:08:42.391 --> 00:08:47.350
In some ways, this is a comic opera,
and in others, it's a tragic opera.

136
00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:51.080
And with Mozart, that's typical.

137
00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:54.900
With Mozart,
you never know whether to laugh or to cry.

138
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.240
Let's phase it out here.

139
00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:00.570
What's this story about?

140
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:04.080
Well, it's an old one based
on the Don Juan legend.

141
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.670
Don Giovanni is simply the Italian for
the Spanish Don Juan.

142
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:12.970
So it's the story of a Don Juan,
misogynist, a woman hater who seduces,

143
00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:15.970
often rapes,
every woman who comes into view simply for

144
00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.750
the sadistic pleasure of conquest and
control.

145
00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:24.440
Don Giovanni is also the leading
nobleman of the town.

146
00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:31.890
Here the upper crust of our high end art,
high end society, is the evil villain, and

147
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:38.290
the heroes are the peasants who work to
unmask Don Juan and restore social order.

148
00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:42.240
When Mozart and Lorenzo de Ponte created
this version of the Don Juan tale,

149
00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:45.000
they wrote about social tension.

150
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.940
This was dangerous stuff.

151
00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:50.092
This was incendiary stuff,
revolutionary stuff.

152
00:09:50.092 --> 00:09:55.353
The French Revolution came only
two years after Don Giovanni,

153
00:09:55.353 --> 00:09:59.233
opera, 1787, revolution, 1789.

154
00:09:59.233 --> 00:10:03.393
The tension and conflict here
between the noblemen on one side and

155
00:10:03.393 --> 00:10:08.308
the peasants on the other, occurs right
in the first scene when the servant,

156
00:10:08.308 --> 00:10:13.300
or butler Leporello, complains about
his life, complains about working for

157
00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.731
Don Giovanni,
complains about working for the man.

158
00:10:16.731 --> 00:10:21.550
In this scene, he's keeping watch for
his master while

159
00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:26.685
master Don Giovanni attempts
another conquest upstairs.

160
00:10:26.685 --> 00:10:29.760
But this time,
the seduction has gone tragically awry.

161
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.700
The lady in question does not succumb.

162
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:36.440
She fights off the masked assailant and
calls for help from her father,

163
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.980
the aging Commendatore, or
Commander, an old military man.

164
00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.510
The commander confronts Don Giovanni and
challenges him to a duel.

165
00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:47.050
At first, Don Giovanni refuses.

166
00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:49.370
I don't fight with old men, he says.

167
00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:51.890
But then the two go at it.

168
00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:55.190
Well, how do you write
a sword fight in music?

169
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:56.700
Mozart shows us how.

170
00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:01.560
Plenty of fast, rising scales,
music that goes up course in

171
00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:06.480
melodic sequences, melodic symbol,
of course, for building tension.

172
00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:11.068
And it's always in minor, of course,
and it's full of diminished chords.

173
00:11:11.068 --> 00:11:14.612
Now, let me play a little bit of this for
you.

174
00:11:14.612 --> 00:11:19.231
[SOUND] And by coincidence,
we start on our D minor chord.

175
00:11:19.231 --> 00:11:29.231
[MUSIC]

176
00:11:42.605 --> 00:11:49.476
[SOUND] And right there you know that
the Commendatore gets it in the stomach.

177
00:11:49.476 --> 00:11:50.185
We have this.

178
00:11:50.185 --> 00:11:52.021
[MUSIC]

179
00:11:52.021 --> 00:11:57.462
Diminished chord fraught with
tension made up of nothing but

180
00:11:57.462 --> 00:12:03.021
minor thirds, and
that's how you signify tension in music.

181
00:12:05.182 --> 00:12:10.865
Now, we could watch The Metropolitan Opera
perform this scene from Don Giovanni,

182
00:12:10.865 --> 00:12:16.850
but I've chosen, instead, a class video,
because I think it's very good.

183
00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:19.090
Not because my voice is any good.

184
00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:20.150
Actually, it's bad.

185
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:26.148
[LAUGH] But because the block of
this scene, I think, is quite good.

186
00:12:26.148 --> 00:12:31.450
And I'm helped out here by some students
and my dear friend and colleague,

187
00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:36.933
Professor Richard Lolly, playing
the role of the villainous Don Giovanni.

188
00:12:36.933 --> 00:12:44.227
[MUSIC]

189
00:12:44.227 --> 00:12:46.730
>> Where is the villain?

190
00:12:48.202 --> 00:12:50.728
>> And fight me.

191
00:12:50.728 --> 00:12:56.068
>> Try to forgive me,
to fight with old men.

192
00:12:56.068 --> 00:13:03.017
>> Departed coward, I challenge thee.

193
00:13:03.017 --> 00:13:04.682
>> My crime forgives me.

194
00:13:04.682 --> 00:13:05.766
>> Get out of here.

195
00:13:05.766 --> 00:13:06.735
>> No.

196
00:13:06.735 --> 00:13:13.062
>> Departed coward, I challenge thee.

197
00:13:13.062 --> 00:13:14.514
>> Tempt me not.

198
00:13:14.514 --> 00:13:16.483
>> Draw I say.

199
00:13:16.483 --> 00:13:19.971
>> Tempt me not.

200
00:13:19.971 --> 00:13:27.062
>> Old man, come on then.

201
00:13:27.062 --> 00:13:31.687
Your death is near.

202
00:13:31.687 --> 00:13:33.016
>> Ah-ha!

203
00:13:33.016 --> 00:13:34.346
>> [LAUGH]

204
00:13:34.346 --> 00:13:35.802
[MUSIC]

205
00:13:35.802 --> 00:13:37.516
>> [SOUND]

206
00:13:37.516 --> 00:13:47.516
>> [LAUGH]

207
00:13:53.939 --> 00:13:56.027
>> Now we're going to go on to a trio,

208
00:13:56.027 --> 00:14:01.360
a very short one, that's an excellent
example of a vocal ensemble by Mozart.

209
00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.570
What's a vocal ensemble?

210
00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:04.540
Well, obviously, it's a group of singers.

211
00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:08.510
But in the case of Mozart, it's a very
special kind of ensemble, three, four,

212
00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:13.700
five, even six soloists, each of
whom has a different point of view.

213
00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:18.250
They don't speak their emotions in
succession as they would in an older

214
00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:22.250
Baroque opera seria, but
all together vocal counterpoint here.

215
00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:29.060
Using a vocal ensemble,
Mozart can move the drama along faster.

216
00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:33.680
Mozart's kind of opera is more fluid,
faster paced, and more realistic.

217
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:38.290
Here's how this little
vocal ensemble plays out.

218
00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:40.110
>> Don Giovanni is over top of him.

219
00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:42.865
Mozart wrote this
exquisite little trio here.

220
00:14:42.865 --> 00:14:44.300
It goes by very quickly.

221
00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:45.690
No body ever noticed it, but

222
00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:49.260
it's some of the most beautiful
music that he ever wrote.

223
00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.048
We ended up on a diminished chord.

224
00:14:51.048 --> 00:14:54.600
Santana, play that diminished chord again,
at the top of that line,

225
00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.710
where he gets stabbed.

226
00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:58.600
>> Yep.
[SOUND]

227
00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.124
>> Okay, and

228
00:14:59.124 --> 00:15:00.647
then we have this little trio.

229
00:15:00.647 --> 00:15:02.945
Leporello, are you back there, Leporello?

230
00:15:02.945 --> 00:15:03.601
>> I am.

231
00:15:03.601 --> 00:15:04.770
>> Okay.

232
00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:05.810
He is just cowering.

233
00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:07.840
He just wants to get out of here.

234
00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.470
This is the worst thing he's ever seen.

235
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:12.720
Don Giovanni is a bit surprised but
says, you had it coming to you, and

236
00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:16.510
the Commendatore is about
to buy the farm here.

237
00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:17.736
He's on his way out.

238
00:15:17.736 --> 00:15:20.908
So, it says this little, oh,
I don't know, 10, 12 measures or so

239
00:15:20.908 --> 00:15:22.425
of exquisitely beautiful music.

240
00:15:22.425 --> 00:15:23.976
And we'll do it nice and slowly for you.

241
00:15:26.566 --> 00:15:36.566
[MUSIC].

242
00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:10.478
Are

243
00:16:10.478 --> 00:16:20.646
you

244
00:16:20.646 --> 00:16:30.646
there?

245
00:16:44.372 --> 00:16:45.904
Let I then look.

246
00:16:45.904 --> 00:16:47.332
>> Well great fun.

247
00:16:47.332 --> 00:16:51.128
And actually great,
indeed extraordinary, music.

248
00:16:51.128 --> 00:16:53.910
Some of the most beautiful music
as you saw there in the film.

249
00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:55.790
Some fo the most beautiful
music Mozart ever wrote.

250
00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:58.844
And it goes by so quickly.

251
00:16:58.844 --> 00:17:00.581
But let's see how all of this turns out.

252
00:17:00.581 --> 00:17:03.154
We're gonna turn now to
the end of the opera,

253
00:17:03.154 --> 00:17:06.205
where the deceased Commendatore
comes back to life,

254
00:17:06.205 --> 00:17:10.093
exacts retribution from Don Giovanni,
and drags him down to hell.

255
00:17:10.093 --> 00:17:20.093
[MUSIC]

256
00:17:21.502 --> 00:17:24.985
Give me you hand as a pledge,
the commendatory says.

257
00:17:24.985 --> 00:17:26.204
Here it is.

258
00:17:26.204 --> 00:17:36.204
[MUSIC]

259
00:17:50.523 --> 00:17:52.057
In repent.

260
00:17:52.057 --> 00:17:55.874
[MUSIC]

261
00:17:55.874 --> 00:17:56.654
Repent yourself.

262
00:17:56.654 --> 00:17:58.893
[MUSIC]

263
00:17:58.893 --> 00:17:59.509
Repent again.

264
00:17:59.509 --> 00:18:03.895
[MUSIC]

265
00:18:03.895 --> 00:18:04.966
no, no, no.

266
00:18:04.966 --> 00:18:14.966
[MUSIC]

267
00:18:21.902 --> 00:18:23.006
Your time is up.

268
00:18:23.006 --> 00:18:32.478
[MUSIC]

269
00:18:32.478 --> 00:18:33.976
Earth is trembling.

270
00:18:33.976 --> 00:18:34.881
Spirits assail me.

271
00:18:34.881 --> 00:18:41.254
[MUSIC]

272
00:18:41.254 --> 00:18:43.333
I'm swallowed up in vortices.

273
00:18:43.333 --> 00:18:45.121
World.

274
00:18:45.121 --> 00:18:55.121
[MUSIC]

275
00:19:07.364 --> 00:19:12.115
Consumed by horrible fires,

276
00:19:12.115 --> 00:19:17.060
that burn because of the fuel.

277
00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:17.803
Etc.

278
00:19:17.803 --> 00:19:18.325
Etc.

279
00:19:18.325 --> 00:19:28.325
[MUSIC]

280
00:19:48.496 --> 00:19:50.661
So that's a film version of Don Giovanni.

281
00:19:50.661 --> 00:19:54.115
And that final scene or next to
last scene is very difficult to do,

282
00:19:54.115 --> 00:19:58.050
needless to say,
onstage without burning the place down.

283
00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:03.410
Now whenever you think of the villanous
Don Giovanni as he goes down to hell here

284
00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:08.020
at least you've got to admit that
he's a man of resolute principle.

285
00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:09.220
No no no.

286
00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:10.760
I will not repent.

287
00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.010
As to hell he goes.

288
00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:17.290
We used to think of Mozart and
his music as light.

289
00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:18.060
Fast.

290
00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:19.920
Zany sometimes.

291
00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:24.701
But with the great opera Don Giovanni
we see the other side of Mozart,

292
00:20:24.701 --> 00:20:29.828
the demonic Mozart, the dark, and
of course, the minor side of Mozart.
