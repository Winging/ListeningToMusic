[MUSIC]

2
00:00:15.604 --> 00:00:18.221
Most of us have heard the story
about Mozart's death.

3
00:00:18.221 --> 00:00:23.000
That he died young and suddenly and
unappreciated and poor.

4
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.630
Even thrown in a pauper's grave.

5
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.000
And that, possibly,
he was poisoned by the composer,

6
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.380
his supposed arch-rival, Antonio Salieri.

7
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.250
Well the only thing that's true about all
of this is that Mozart died young, age 35.

8
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.828
But oddly, what's surprising is
not that Mozart died young but

9
00:00:42.828 --> 00:00:46.370
that he lived [LAUGH] as long as he did.

10
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.260
Of course,
these were the days before antibiotics and

11
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.510
he had a frail constitution to begin with.

12
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.000
And he had small pox as a child,
which he survived.

13
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.050
And he has rheumatic fever,
which damaged his heart.

14
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.330
And this was the 18th century,
so the custom was, and

15
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.480
as Mozart observed it, that when
a family member got seriously ill, he or

16
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:13.190
she was bled, to drain off the bad humors,
medical superstition.

17
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.480
So again, it's a wonder that
he lived as long as he did.

18
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.550
As to the truth of the situation,

19
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.470
in his last year, when he was suddenly
taken ill, Mozart was doing rather well.

20
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.560
Granted the years 1788 through 1790
had been tough, as it was then for

21
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.330
all entertainers in Vienna, and Mozart
was an entertainer as well as an artist.

22
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.600
The Austrian emperor, the boss,
was at war with the Turks.

23
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.130
The aristocracy had fled Vienna,
and the economy collapsed.

24
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.400
But by 1791 both the emperor and
Mozart were on the rebound.

25
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.810
He had written a highly successful opera,
The Magic Flute, that was playing,

26
00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.030
in effect, off-broadway in a Vienna
theater, raking in the money.

27
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.520
And he had received and executed
a commission for an opera seria for

28
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.120
the emperor as well as a commission for
a requiem mass.

29
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.100
So Mozart wasn't exactly poverty stricken.

30
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.400
And he'd been promised the position of
music director at the Cathedral of St.

31
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.840
Stephen's when the incumbent died,
that was soon expected.

32
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.890
So here we are, again, in the center of
Vienna, you can see the map up there as it

33
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:31.097
was in the late 18th century, and as it
is today, the St. Stephen's Cathedral.

34
00:02:31.097 --> 00:02:35.610
And, as evidence of his greatly
improved economic fortunes,

35
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.290
Mozart had moved from
the suburb back into town and

36
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.590
into an expensive apartment on
Wallenstein Gasa here as the map

37
00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.350
shows us right behind the cathedral
at the blue arrow that we can see.

38
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.740
And here's how the apartment
looked in Mozart's day.

39
00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.140
The Mozarts were on the second floor.

40
00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.700
Let me see if my pointer is working here.

41
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.690
The pointer is showing this window here,
and this window over here, and

42
00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.650
this window over here,
all on the second floor.

43
00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.900
Now here's a diagram of that apartment,
made at the time of Mozart's death,

44
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.060
when his possessions had to
go through probate court.

45
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.660
There are three windows and

46
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.500
these are the three windows that we
just looked at here, here and here.

47
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.450
Here we see Mozart's composing room at M.

48
00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.025
Here we see his piano, which we
have already seen the actual piano.

49
00:03:28.025 --> 00:03:31.925
And here around these two windows
his desk and some chairs and

50
00:03:31.925 --> 00:03:35.045
a sofa for
his friends when they came to visit.

51
00:03:35.045 --> 00:03:39.165
Here is Mozart's bedroom
with the bed itself and

52
00:03:39.165 --> 00:03:43.705
a billiard table over here which Mozart
obviously did have in his bedroom but

53
00:03:43.705 --> 00:03:46.495
that's, [LAUGH] that's another story.

54
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.750
So as I say, Mozart was doing quite well,

55
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.150
thank you very much,
in what proved to be his last year, 1791.

56
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.970
But late in November 1791,
Mozart was taken ill.

57
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.780
And within two weeks,
despite the doctor's best,

58
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.600
or inadvertently the doctor's
worst efforts, he died.

59
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.680
We can't be sure of what he died from.

60
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.900
Kidney failure with an adverse
effect on an already damaged heart

61
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.020
is the most likely cause.

62
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:21.500
Anyway, Mozart's death has
often been romanticized.

63
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.730
Here are a couple of 19th century
romantic paintings of that final scene.

64
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:33.570
Painting one, you can see the music
around the bed there and then, image two,

65
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.730
same sort of thing, music on the bed with
a group of singers off to the right.

66
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.890
Now, there is some truth to this scene

67
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.720
because while lying on what
was to prove his death bed,

68
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:53.450
Mozart Rehearsed the vocal parts of some
of the Requiem, and he sang the tenor.

69
00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.600
And there's an account of
Mozart's last moments recorded

70
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.750
by his sister-in-law, Sophie Haibel.

71
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.846
So let me read that to you
out of the Mozart documents.

72
00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:10.770
By Otto Erik Deutsch Sussmayr,
now Sussmayr is a pupil of Mozart.

73
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.605
Sussmayr was there at
Mozart's bed side and

74
00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:16.650
the well known requiem
lay on the cover left.

75
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.510
Then Mozart explaining to him
how he thought, he Sussmayr,

76
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.600
should finish it after his death and
the little slightly later.

77
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.280
There was a long search for Dr.

78
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.022
Close, who was found in the theater, but
he had to wait until the play was over.

79
00:05:34.022 --> 00:05:36.758
[LAUGH] Mozart was dying,
he had to wait until the play was over.

80
00:05:36.758 --> 00:05:43.420
And the Doctor came and prescribed cold
compresses on his burning forehead.

81
00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:47.670
And this gave him such a shock that
he did not regain consciousness

82
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:48.990
before he passed away.

83
00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:56.310
The last thing he did was to try and meld
the sound of the timpani in his requiem.

84
00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.550
So a pretty graphic description
of Mozart's last moments.

85
00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.840
Well, Mozart.

86
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.720
He didn't finish the Requiem but, with
the help of one of his students as we saw

87
00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.760
there, particularly Franz Xaver Sussmayr,
it was completed and Mozart's widow

88
00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.920
ultimately collected the remaining half
of the commission the composer was owed.

89
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.250
We'll take a look at this Requiem
manuscript in just a moment, but

90
00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.140
first of all, what's a requiem?

91
00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:23.630
What's a requiem mass?

92
00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:29.850
Well as you can see by the slide here,
on the left we have the standard portions

93
00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:34.040
of a mass, we've looked at
this already in our course.

94
00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.670
And on the right,
the more specific mass for

95
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:43.680
the burial of a Catholic Christian,
which Mozart was.

96
00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.240
So, as you can see, from the standard
mass, the Gloria has been removed.

97
00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.540
This, of course,
is not a happy celebratory moment.

98
00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:55.760
And an important other chant has
been inserted, the Dies irae.

99
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.250
Day of rest, day of judgement,
the last judgement.

100
00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:04.280
So the Dies irae is an extremely
vivid text and chant.

101
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.040
And, indeed, sometimes frightening.

102
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:11.850
But let's start at the beginning of
the Mozart requiem with the entry of

103
00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:16.940
the clergy and the Introit,
as, in a performance done in

104
00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:22.310
1991 to commemorate the 200th
anniversary of Mozart;s death.

105
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:27.560
The commemoration took place
in the Cathedral of St.

106
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:34.460
Steven with the Vienna Philharmonic and
Sir Georg Solti conducting.

107
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:35.720
Here we are in the cathedral.

108
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.870
The alter is behind us.

109
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:40.699
[MUSIC]

110
00:07:40.699 --> 00:07:42.385
Beginning in D minor.

111
00:07:42.385 --> 00:07:44.112
[MUSIC]

112
00:07:44.112 --> 00:07:44.986
Slow

113
00:07:44.986 --> 00:07:47.830
[MUSIC]

114
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:49.110
and somber.

115
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:55.344
[MUSIC]

116
00:07:55.344 --> 00:07:56.385
Hear the clarinet.

117
00:07:56.385 --> 00:07:57.511
[MUSIC]

118
00:07:57.511 --> 00:07:59.557
Bassoon.

119
00:07:59.557 --> 00:08:00.887
Look at those clarinets.

120
00:08:00.887 --> 00:08:05.672
We'll come back Then there's special kind
of low clarinets called basset horns.

121
00:08:05.672 --> 00:08:08.430
They give this mournful quality to it.

122
00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:09.870
There you see trombones.

123
00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:12.330
We haven't had trombones
in symphonies yet.

124
00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:16.200
But there still part of
the religious music of this period.

125
00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:20.607
So masses going back all the way into the
15th century were already using trombones.

126
00:08:20.607 --> 00:08:22.932
[MUSIC]

127
00:08:22.932 --> 00:08:27.178
Where the actual test requiem.

128
00:08:27.178 --> 00:08:37.303
[MUSIC]

129
00:08:37.303 --> 00:08:40.148
Now we're looking at
the west end of the church.

130
00:08:40.148 --> 00:08:50.148
[MUSIC]

131
00:08:55.397 --> 00:08:58.805
Requiem mater, may he have eternal rest.

132
00:08:58.805 --> 00:09:07.975
[MUSIC]

133
00:09:07.975 --> 00:09:13.612
It looks perpetual may eternal life shine

134
00:09:13.612 --> 00:09:18.774
upon you on this moment of judgement.

135
00:09:18.774 --> 00:09:24.023
[FOREIGN] May it shine.

136
00:09:24.023 --> 00:09:25.225
Big crescendo.

137
00:09:25.225 --> 00:09:33.897
[MUSIC]

138
00:09:33.897 --> 00:09:41.004
And then, once again, the mournful
somber sound of the basset horns and

139
00:09:41.004 --> 00:09:47.430
as we go into the next section of
the intro it will fade it out here.

140
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:50.130
Okay let's move on now.

141
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:55.280
We're going to move on following
our slide to the Dies irae.

142
00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:59.610
Dies irae, of course,
is that vivid section of the Requiem.

143
00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:04.130
And the last two parts of it
are the Confutatis and the Lacrimosa.

144
00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:06.610
So let's look at the music
of the Confutatis.

145
00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:14.721
Here we have down below, starting with
the basses and tenors, this sort of sound.

146
00:10:14.721 --> 00:10:23.348
[MUSIC]

147
00:10:23.348 --> 00:10:26.439
Very low, very agitated, very minor.

148
00:10:26.439 --> 00:10:27.816
[MUSIC].

149
00:10:27.816 --> 00:10:31.012
The voices enter, I think let's
see what comes in first here,

150
00:10:31.012 --> 00:10:32.471
looks like the tenor voice.

151
00:10:32.471 --> 00:10:34.179
[MUSIC]

152
00:10:34.179 --> 00:10:35.205
Maybe the bass voice.

153
00:10:35.205 --> 00:10:38.660
[MUSIC.

154
00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:43.210
That interval there is an extremely
difficult and dissonant one.

155
00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:45.890
So we have, actually it's
called the diabolus in music.

156
00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:50.700
So we've got the devil baked
into this hellish scene here.

157
00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:52.449
All down in minor.

158
00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:55.149
Coming up step by step.

159
00:10:55.149 --> 00:10:59.898
[MUSIC]

160
00:10:59.898 --> 00:11:04.354
Then the upper voices come in,
the female voices, very high.

161
00:11:04.354 --> 00:11:11.429
[MUSIC]

162
00:11:11.429 --> 00:11:14.160
[FOREIGN] call me.
Call me with the blessed.

163
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.730
It's all high.

164
00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:19.180
It's all consonant.

165
00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:21.540
It's all major.

166
00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.380
So it's a very different sort of sound.

167
00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:27.800
So he's separating out here the two
textures and the two styles.

168
00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.180
The hellish and the elect.

169
00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:33.150
And this is part of an old
Christian tradition.

170
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:38.230
Let's look at here in our next slide
an altarpiece of Hans Memling,

171
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:41.380
where the damned are thrust into Hell.

172
00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:44.740
And they're on the left side of God,
the sinister side.

173
00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:49.346
And the left are on the right side of God.

174
00:11:51.393 --> 00:11:58.690
So let's go back now and hear a bit of
this following the arrows on the screen.

175
00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:02.805
[MUSIC]

176
00:12:02.805 --> 00:12:03.731
From the agitated bases.

177
00:12:03.731 --> 00:12:13.768
[MUSIC]

178
00:12:13.768 --> 00:12:16.856
Very quick modulation, C Major.

179
00:12:16.856 --> 00:12:26.856
[MUSIC]

180
00:12:28.148 --> 00:12:32.553
Back to the low sounds, the agitated
sounds, the minor sounds, the painful,

181
00:12:32.553 --> 00:12:34.473
tortured sounds of those in Hell.

182
00:12:34.473 --> 00:12:43.352
[MUSIC]

183
00:12:43.352 --> 00:12:49.770
Okay, and then back up to the high sound
square I'd like to leave this within.

184
00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:50.840
We'll fade out there.

185
00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:57.170
Now we come to the last
movement of the dies irae.

186
00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:59.540
And the last music that Mozart wrote.

187
00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:03.150
Music finished often orchestrated,
as we saw, by his pupil Süssmayr.

188
00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:09.260
Lets take a look at this last image here.

189
00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:13.940
Here we have the next to last piece
of paper that Mozart ever wrote on.

190
00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:15.890
It's the Lacrimosa and

191
00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:19.860
you can see up at the top there
we have the three string part.

192
00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:23.410
Three stringed parts, first violin,
second violins, violas,

193
00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:28.660
and then the basses of the orchestra
are actually down here underneath.

194
00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:33.450
And then the four choral parts,
soprano, alto, tenor, and bass.

195
00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:38.840
At the text and this is a particularly
important text, qual ray surgen.

196
00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:44.393
Notice that ascending
scale that is going up

197
00:13:44.393 --> 00:13:45.643
[MUSIC]

198
00:13:45.643 --> 00:13:50.953
Then we go across the page and
that scale continues and

199
00:13:50.953 --> 00:13:54.971
indeed it becomes even more chromatic.

200
00:13:54.971 --> 00:13:56.726
[MUSIC]

201
00:13:56.726 --> 00:13:58.590
And more intense as it goes.

202
00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:01.560
That's why I color-coded that with a red.

203
00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.130
And that's where Mozart's
music broke off and

204
00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:09.060
that little snippet that you see
following it is in the hand of Sussymr.

205
00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:14.400
So let's focus on this extraordinary
passage here in our next line.

206
00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:19.055
So here's a modern edition
of it with the words

207
00:14:19.055 --> 00:14:22.740
(foreign) fa-vil-la ju-di
can-dus ho-mo re-us.

208
00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:28.730
On that day in which out of the ashes
will rise the just person to be judged.

209
00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:31.315
So it's starting down very low.

210
00:14:31.315 --> 00:14:38.516
[MUSIC]

211
00:14:38.516 --> 00:14:42.096
And now it gets even more
intense with the chromaticism.

212
00:14:42.096 --> 00:14:43.102
[MUSIC]

213
00:14:43.102 --> 00:14:49.379
With the top part.

214
00:14:49.379 --> 00:14:51.814
All the way up to the,

215
00:14:51.814 --> 00:14:57.223
[MUSIC]

216
00:14:57.223 --> 00:15:01.611
The triumphant peak at the top of this.

217
00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:06.580
Okay, let's go on now to here,
this extraordinary movement.

218
00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:10.720
But before we do so, let's work through
a couple of initial slides here.

219
00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:16.209
It starts out with what I like to think

220
00:15:16.209 --> 00:15:22.594
of as a funeral quartet sounding this way.

221
00:15:22.594 --> 00:15:26.265
[MUSIC]

222
00:15:26.265 --> 00:15:31.760
And then we have the scalar passage that
we've already studied just a moment ago.

223
00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:34.060
That's the B material rising up.

224
00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:38.440
Then at A the funeral quartet comes back.

225
00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:43.406
Over on the next page, we can see that
once again the extraordinary ascent is

226
00:15:43.406 --> 00:15:47.302
built into this, but
now it's occurring in the bass part.

227
00:15:47.302 --> 00:15:56.435
[MUSIC]

228
00:15:56.435 --> 00:16:00.140
And so on, so it's coming up again,
rising from the dead.

229
00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:01.429
In the basses.

230
00:16:01.429 --> 00:16:06.836
Then, in the next passage,
at C you can see that we have,

231
00:16:06.836 --> 00:16:11.464
for the first time,
a reference to Christ here.

232
00:16:11.464 --> 00:16:14.589
[FOREIGN].

233
00:16:14.589 --> 00:16:20.353
I'm having a little
trouble reading the text,

234
00:16:20.353 --> 00:16:23.528
but [FOREIGN] save me Lord.

235
00:16:23.528 --> 00:16:29.910
[FOREIGN].

236
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:33.810
So, at that point,
the text starts referring to or

237
00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:37.815
is referring to [FOREIGN],
pious, merciful Jesus.

238
00:16:37.815 --> 00:16:39.765
And there's a modulation for

239
00:16:39.765 --> 00:16:43.433
the first time out of the somber
D-minor to a major key.

240
00:16:43.433 --> 00:16:48.297
And then as we go across,
we'll hear the sound of the clarinet.

241
00:16:48.297 --> 00:16:52.386
And a modulation will take us back
from the sweet sound of the major,

242
00:16:52.386 --> 00:16:55.160
back to the demonic sound of the minor.

243
00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:58.830
The funeral cortege comes
back with the letter A there.

244
00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:03.200
And at B, we have our ascent, but this
time our ascent's turning the other way.

245
00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.335
It's all going down, and
it's going down in polyphonic texture,

246
00:17:06.335 --> 00:17:08.984
starting with the basses,
picked up with the sopranos.

247
00:17:08.984 --> 00:17:11.039
And down, down, down it goes.

248
00:17:11.039 --> 00:17:16.338
And at the very end we will
have there a very somber

249
00:17:16.338 --> 00:17:21.120
sort of Amen cadence
that is very powerfully

250
00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:25.950
affected either by Mozart or by Sussmayr.

251
00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:29.070
So the last music that Mozart ever wrote.

252
00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:34.603
Let's go back to the beginning and we'll
listen and I'll comment as we proceed.

253
00:17:34.603 --> 00:17:44.044
[MUSIC]

254
00:17:44.044 --> 00:17:47.749
So here we go with the funeral cortege or
at least as I like to hear it,

255
00:17:47.749 --> 00:17:48.860
a funeral cortege.

256
00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:54.411
The conductor here is Neville Marriner,
who's chosen a very slow tempo,

257
00:17:54.411 --> 00:18:00.153
but that has the virtue of letting the
beauty of the music stand out even more.

258
00:18:00.153 --> 00:18:04.750
[MUSIC]

259
00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:07.535
Okay, now here comes our rise.

260
00:18:07.535 --> 00:18:09.636
[MUSIC]

261
00:18:09.636 --> 00:18:12.457
And as the ashes, purgatory.

262
00:18:12.457 --> 00:18:21.611
[MUSIC]

263
00:18:21.611 --> 00:18:26.916
Now, a scale turns into
a climatic scale as the music

264
00:18:26.916 --> 00:18:31.629
crescendoed, Mozart himself wrote this in.

265
00:18:31.629 --> 00:18:38.711
[MUSIC]

266
00:18:38.711 --> 00:18:47.170
Back to the initial
swinging funeral cortege.

267
00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:49.242
So here we go across the page.

268
00:18:49.242 --> 00:18:53.444
[MUSIC]

269
00:18:53.444 --> 00:18:57.984
Mozart has re-orchestrated this
in a way that the chromatic

270
00:18:57.984 --> 00:19:02.446
ascent is now in the bass line,
at the ascending red arrow.

271
00:19:02.446 --> 00:19:09.540
It's a climatic ascent, hence the red.

272
00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:16.828
Basses are rising, but
now breaking up the rise in octaves.

273
00:19:16.828 --> 00:19:24.242
[MUSIC]

274
00:19:24.242 --> 00:19:28.892
Now here's the text,

275
00:19:28.892 --> 00:19:35.261
therefore save us, [FOREIGN].

276
00:19:35.261 --> 00:19:37.001
[FOREIGN], spare us.

277
00:19:37.001 --> 00:19:38.581
[MUSIC]

278
00:19:38.581 --> 00:19:42.314
[FOREIGN] here comes

279
00:19:42.314 --> 00:19:48.614
the modulation from the major,

280
00:19:48.614 --> 00:19:53.986
appropriate for the text.

281
00:19:53.986 --> 00:20:00.058
[MUSIC]

282
00:20:00.058 --> 00:20:06.199
Landing in a peaceful,
even Arcadian F major.

283
00:20:06.199 --> 00:20:08.072
And as we go across the page,

284
00:20:08.072 --> 00:20:12.141
the modulation will begin again
with our mournful clarinet.

285
00:20:12.141 --> 00:20:20.582
[MUSIC]

286
00:20:20.582 --> 00:20:25.038
Here it comes, the crescendo,

287
00:20:25.038 --> 00:20:30.984
back to the minor, to the original music.

288
00:20:30.984 --> 00:20:40.984
[MUSIC]

289
00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:52.932
Hear the ascent, of course it's
turned in the opposite direction.

290
00:20:52.932 --> 00:20:59.379
[MUSIC]

291
00:20:59.379 --> 00:21:04.023
Emphasizing not triumph, but resolution.

292
00:21:04.023 --> 00:21:14.023
[MUSIC]

293
00:21:15.143 --> 00:21:18.486
One last cry from the orchestra.

294
00:21:18.486 --> 00:21:28.486
[MUSIC]

295
00:21:44.362 --> 00:21:48.007
And it ended there on a hopeful note,
with the final turn to major.

296
00:21:48.007 --> 00:21:51.327
[MUSIC]

297
00:21:51.327 --> 00:21:54.870
So this is extraordinary music,
that ascent in particular.

298
00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:59.723
Starting low and in despair and
rising high to a feeling of triumph and

299
00:21:59.723 --> 00:22:00.737
exaltation.

300
00:22:00.737 --> 00:22:04.532
Well this can be applied to many
aspects of human existence.

301
00:22:04.532 --> 00:22:11.050
Many aspects of everyday mundane
existence, as the next slide suggests.

302
00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:15.970
>> The last four hours have seen
one child fail to get to the air

303
00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:16.930
sickness bag in time.

304
00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:20.160
>> So in the background in this
TV commercial for Bookings.com,

305
00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:23.840
you hear the Mozart Requiem
beginning with the funeral cortege.

306
00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:27.280
But already, he's cut to the ascent.

307
00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.740
>> Until now.

308
00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:33.382
>> Coming up, now as we open the room,
we hit the climactic ascent.

309
00:22:33.382 --> 00:22:37.223
We're getting higher and
higher, toward exultation.

310
00:22:37.223 --> 00:22:38.885
>> Booking.com.

311
00:22:38.885 --> 00:22:40.280
Booking.yeah.

312
00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:44.950
>> Well, Mozart's a genius.

313
00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:45.580
What's a genius?

314
00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:52.080
Somebody that has staying power over
the centuries and across cultures.

315
00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:56.800
In any event,
that's the end of the Requiem and

316
00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.760
that actually the end of Mozart's music.

317
00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:01.020
And that's the end of
our session on Mozart.

318
00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:04.390
But before we leave him,
let's review in simple terms

319
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:09.590
not just what makes Mozart great, but what
makes him extraordinary, surely unique.

320
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:11.060
What makes Mozart great?

321
00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:13.570
Well universality, we talked about that.

322
00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:16.980
He wrote in all genres,
particularly opera.

323
00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:22.190
Writing symphonies, concertos, string
quartets, and operas is exceptional.

324
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:25.370
Perfect balance and perfect proportions.

325
00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:29.806
Both Albert Einstein and
George Bernard Shaw commented on this.

326
00:23:29.806 --> 00:23:33.755
I think it was Shaw who
said that Mozart's music

327
00:23:33.755 --> 00:23:38.430
would not sound out of
place in the voice of God.

328
00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:42.650
And this sense of the balance and
proportion is particularly important,

329
00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:44.070
I think, in his music.

330
00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:48.820
This capacity for the endless and
effortless supply of melodies,

331
00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:53.610
we've already heard
a great number of them.

332
00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:57.240
The greatest beauty from
the simplest of ideas.

333
00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:00.756
We could go back to
the C Major piano concerto, but

334
00:24:00.756 --> 00:24:03.950
here's a little reminder of that capacity.

335
00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:10.880
[MUSIC]

336
00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.490
I'll pause it right there.

337
00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:14.850
Greatest beauty from
the simplest of ideas.

338
00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:20.370
Great beauty from even that sort of
nursery rhyme of a melody that he created.

339
00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:24.600
And then finally, the fullest range
of musical and human emotions.

340
00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:28.570
And we saw that right there with
the arising ascent in the Requiem,

341
00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:31.930
where we go from the depths of
despair to the heights of triumph.

342
00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:38.550
Well, these are some of the things that
make Mozart's music extraordinary.

343
00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:43.599
And if you like our visit with Mozart and
thought his music exceptional,

344
00:24:43.599 --> 00:24:49.088
I'll leave you with a list of my favorite
pieces by Mozart and books about him.

345
00:24:49.088 --> 00:24:59.088
