[MUSIC]

2
00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:14.290
Beethoven is a well known figure,
not just in music, but in western culture.

3
00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.830
I'm holding here a copy of
a Charles Schultz Peanuts cartoon.

4
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.310
I won't put it up for long,

5
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.870
because likely it's being
governed by rigid copyright laws.

6
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.520
But it shows Linus and
Lucy at a grand piano.

7
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.180
And on top of it sits a bust of Beethoven.

8
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.040
There were lots of busts of
Beethoven from the 19th century on.

9
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.490
And here I have an action
figure of Beethoven.

10
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.250
Now I don't know what action he's up to,
but surely he's up to something powerful.

11
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.270
And indeed, prior to the film Amadeus,
which centered on Mozart, when the average

12
00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.910
educated listener thought of classical
music, the go-to guy for classical music,

13
00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.476
who thought of a musical motive from
classical musical such as this.

14
00:01:02.476 --> 00:01:08.060
[MUSIC]

15
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.520
Thought of Beethoven and his music.

16
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.290
After Amadeus, however,

17
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.790
public consciousness about classical
music begins to shift a bit to Mozart.

18
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.940
So these two figures,
Mozart and Beethoven,

19
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.600
stand at the heart of western classical
music, chronologically and culturally.

20
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.490
So let's compare them.

21
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.570
And let's pursue this by means of a quiz.

22
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.020
So here we have on our screen
a series of questions.

23
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.720
Which composer was a child
prodigy on the keyboard?

24
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.700
Which would you imagine?

25
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.070
Well they both actually were.

26
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.990
Which composer had
a father in the business,

27
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.480
who was also a professional musician?

28
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.950
Well, again, they both did.

29
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.830
Leopold was a violinist,
Johann van Beethoven,

30
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.890
he was a tenor in the choir
at the Court of Bonn.

31
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.730
Which composer had an abusive father

32
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.910
who locked him in the basement
if he didn't practice?

33
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.960
That may be a slight exaggeration but
not much of one.

34
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.740
Well, in this case, it's Beethoven,
because father Leopold Mozart,

35
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.890
provided a very enlightened education and
upbringing for his son.

36
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.800
Four, which composer had
a father who passed him off

37
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.850
a year younger than he really was?

38
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.180
Well, again, both fathers did this.

39
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.180
Father Beethoven sometimes tried
to pass him off as being two years

40
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.420
younger than he really was.

41
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.000
Both of these gentlemen were short,
so it was feasible.

42
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.270
And Beethoven went through his entire
life, imagine that, went through his

43
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:48.570
entire life thinking he was actually
two years younger than he really was.

44
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:55.054
When he died in 1827,
Beethoven believed that he was 55, not 57.

45
00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.090
Which composer was skilled on the violin
and organ as well as the piano?

46
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.220
Well, both of them were.

47
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.750
Which composer was short and
had a pockmarked face?

48
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.280
Well, Beethoven from birth and

49
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.640
Mozart also from his experience,
as we mentioned before, with smallpox.

50
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.140
Which composer had absolute pitch,
or perfect pitch?

51
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.410
Well, we know for sure that Mozart did and
undoubtedly Beethoven as well.

52
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.310
Let's go onto our next sequences.

53
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.888
Which composer moved from a much
smaller town to Vienna, so

54
00:03:31.888 --> 00:03:36.940
as to test his performing and

55
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.120
compositional skills
against the very best?

56
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.370
Well as you undoubtedly know,
they both did.

57
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.060
Mozart and Beethoven.

58
00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.280
Mozart moving from Salzburg,
Beethoven moving from Bonn.

59
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.762
Which composer enjoyed a lucrative
position as a court composer

60
00:03:55.762 --> 00:03:58.344
to the Holy Roman Emperor in Vienna?

61
00:03:58.344 --> 00:04:01.298
Well here, lucrative is the key word, and

62
00:04:01.298 --> 00:04:06.370
it was really only Mozart who enjoyed
a position here of really any sort.

63
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.100
Beethoven had an annuity
from the Arch Duke, but

64
00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.870
it was not directly from
the Holy Roman Emperor himself.

65
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.440
Which composer studied either directly or

66
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.010
indirectly with the older
master Joseph Haydn?

67
00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.690
Well, they both did, in the sense that
Mozart studied Haydn's scores and

68
00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.160
was a good personal friend of Haydn.

69
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:33.260
And Beethoven studied as a pupil with
the older man, his teach Joseph Haydn.

70
00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.300
Which composer regularly worked,
regularly composed away from the piano.

71
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.300
Away from the piano, not at the piano.

72
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.500
Well, unlike Haydn who worked
at the piano, both Mozart and

73
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:51.000
Beethoven regularly simply composed at
a composing desk of one sort or another.

74
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.450
They had the music in their ears,

75
00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:59.530
they didn't need to get inspiration
from a keyboard instrument of any kind.

76
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.110
Okay, and
now to the personal qualities of this.

77
00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.740
They were very different sorts of people.

78
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.970
Which composer was puctilliously
attentive to his dress?

79
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:10.840
Well, Mozart and

80
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:16.770
you can see how Mozart loved those
red coats with the gold buttons.

81
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.610
Here on the right we see Beethoven.

82
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.170
Actually Beethoven all gussied out.

83
00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:22.820
All ready to go.

84
00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.470
This is, in a sense better
than Beethoven ever looked.

85
00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.780
In terms of his attire,
he was rather messy.

86
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.720
Which composer, following this line along,
which composer was on

87
00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.640
more than one occasion, arrested because
he looked like a derelict or a vagrant?

88
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.630
And that was Beethoven,
wandering around the streets of Vienna.

89
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.870
Which composer got all
tidied up by history?

90
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.360
Well, they both did as we'll see
in the portraits of Beethoven.

91
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.300
He always looked better in his
portraits than he did in reality.

92
00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:04.850
And by Mozart, look at Mozart in
the actual portrait about 1779 or so.

93
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:09.600
And how history has taken that
image out of that portrait and

94
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.560
refined it or prettied it up if you will.

95
00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.960
Which composer was
a prodigy as a composer?

96
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.610
Well here, really only Mozart.

97
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:24.630
Beethoven didn't write anything really
of significance that we play today

98
00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:30.430
until his mid 20s, Mozart,
much earlier, a good decade earlier.

99
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:35.110
Which composer wrote nearly
finished manuscripts, and

100
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.715
which composer labored
mightily on his scores?

101
00:06:38.715 --> 00:06:41.405
Well, to answer this,
let's look at some autographs.

102
00:06:41.405 --> 00:06:44.205
Here's the autographs,
as you can see by the title up there,

103
00:06:44.205 --> 00:06:47.875
of what proved to be
Mozart's last symphony.

104
00:06:47.875 --> 00:06:51.245
The Symphony Number 41.

105
00:06:51.245 --> 00:06:53.575
As you can see, it's neat.

106
00:06:53.575 --> 00:06:54.835
It's a tidy score.

107
00:06:54.835 --> 00:06:56.655
The violins are at the top.

108
00:06:56.655 --> 00:07:01.330
There may be a correction
in the upper left there,

109
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.650
in the second violin part at the arrow.

110
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.980
But the fact that you can tell what
the instruments are tells us something.

111
00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.090
This is a very legible score.

112
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:14.420
And if you're familiar
with Mozart's autographs,

113
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:17.360
you can tell that he is moving
through this at lightning speed.

114
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:23.016
It has to do with the angle of the note
heads and the density of the ink.

115
00:07:23.016 --> 00:07:26.930
So he's just pouring this out
straight out of his head.

116
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:33.130
Now, by comparison let's go over and we'll
see an image of a symphony by Beethoven.

117
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:37.010
Now, when I saw this the title
said Symphony Number 9, and

118
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:43.070
I had to think about, well where
the heck in Symphony Number 9 are we?

119
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:47.390
And I got out a full score and
rooted around a bit, and

120
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:51.650
was able to figure out that we're
in the first movement of this,

121
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:55.180
what also proved to be the last symphony
of Beethoven, his Symphony Number 9.

122
00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:59.708
But what a difference
compared to the Mozart here,

123
00:07:59.708 --> 00:08:03.500
we see correction piled upon correction,

124
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:08.885
one on top of the other,
something of a musical train wreck.

125
00:08:11.798 --> 00:08:15.280
Well here, a picture is indeed
worth a thousand words.

126
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:21.320
The picture Mozart flying by and that of
Beethoven laboring mightily, struggling.

127
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:27.210
And that sense of labor and
struggle oddly, is something that we hear

128
00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:31.740
in the music of Beethoven and
each of us can personally relate to.

129
00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:35.439
So let's explore now the messy Beethoven,
and

130
00:08:35.439 --> 00:08:40.803
how this unusual person became
something of a poster boy, an icon for

131
00:08:40.803 --> 00:08:45.535
the creative artist generally
in the early 19th century.
