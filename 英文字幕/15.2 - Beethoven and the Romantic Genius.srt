[MUSIC]

2
00:00:19.212 --> 00:00:22.102
This image of the disheveled,
disorganized,

3
00:00:22.102 --> 00:00:26.294
oblivious to the world around him
Beethoven, the isolated genius,

4
00:00:26.294 --> 00:00:29.890
was a concept created
during the 19th century.

5
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.640
The classical period in music
spans the 18th and 19th centuries,

6
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.500
and Beethoven spans the classical and
romantic eras.

7
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.250
During the first decades
of the 19th century,

8
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.060
the very notion of the genius as we think
of him or her today comes into being.

9
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.380
Isolated, misunderstood,
struggling, suffering for his art.

10
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.520
No artist or creator better represented or

11
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.030
personified this
development then Beethoven.

12
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.250
Here is contemporary image of
Beethoven composing imaginary or not.

13
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.900
But it doesn't seem to be a happy process.

14
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.520
On the contrary, it's wild and
chaotic at least compared to the image

15
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.460
of the creating artist of
the preceding century.

16
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.290
Namely, Beethoven's teacher, Haydn.

17
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.504
Here's Haydn, neat and tidy,
working at a keyboard.

18
00:01:23.504 --> 00:01:33.129
[MUSIC]

19
00:01:33.129 --> 00:01:34.296
And so on.

20
00:01:34.296 --> 00:01:37.712
And here's the image of Beethoven.

21
00:01:37.712 --> 00:01:44.504
[MUSIC]

22
00:01:44.504 --> 00:01:50.183
Again, I exaggerate, but this image of
the spontaneous, disorganized Beethoven,

23
00:01:50.183 --> 00:01:54.927
the notion of the wild creator crying
in the wilderness, raging with and

24
00:01:54.927 --> 00:02:00.490
against nature, well, that's part
of the growing Romantic aesthetic.

25
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.040
As we see here in this very large canvas
by the English painter John Martin.

26
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.840
The image of the isolated,
struggling artist, poet, or

27
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.410
composer became a stereotype.

28
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.370
One fostered by Beethoven himself.

29
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.800
Now here is Beethoven as poet,
Beethoven the bard.

30
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.280
Beethoven struggling against
the forces of nature and against fate.

31
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.020
There was also, as we'll see in
our next session, a tendency to

32
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.830
think of Beethoven as an unstable
personality, a real oddball.

33
00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.160
Part of this was occasion
by an unsympathetic public

34
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.409
dealing with disability,
Beethoven's growing deafness.

35
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.410
Here on the screen is an account of
Beethoven during the performance of his

36
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:52.840
Ninth Symphony.

37
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.000
Beethoven is called a madman.

38
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.640
When Beethoven himself conducted, he
stood in front of a conductor's stand and

39
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.120
threw himself back and
forth like a madman.

40
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.720
At one point he stretched to his full
height, then next he crouched down to

41
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.090
the floor and
he flailed about with his hands and feet.

42
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.950
Well this notion of the slightly
deranged but brilliant genius

43
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.640
arrives during the early 19th and

44
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.940
into the 20th century when
it was created by figures

45
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.360
such as Mary Shelly as you can see here
with Frankenstein and Victor Hugo with

46
00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.850
the Hunchback of Notre Dame and Gaston
Leroux with the Phantom of the Opera.

47
00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.030
Well in many ways,
it all began with Beethoven.

48
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.504
And here's an image of Beethoven
as he looked at age 48.

49
00:03:44.504 --> 00:03:48.930
Again, Beethoven somewhat tidied up here.

50
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.000
And look now,
the genius of the 20th century.

51
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.790
Well it comes to resemble Beethoven.

52
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.110
Einstein aping Beethoven if you will.

53
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.950
Young Beethoven, as the years went by,

54
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.910
helped create this image of
Beethoven the archetype of genius.

55
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.760
Indeed Beethoven himself promoted it,

56
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.860
this notion that we still have with
us today of the artist as genius.

57
00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.420
As we'll see from the following quotes
embedded in a couple of slides here.

58
00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.420
So this is one about how
the artist suffers for his art.

59
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.550
Quote, the undersigned Beethoven,
and this is Beethoven talking.

60
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.884
The undersigned Beethoven has
been concerned not merely

61
00:04:31.884 --> 00:04:35.296
with earning his daily bread,
but rather, with his art.

62
00:04:35.296 --> 00:04:40.102
With the ennoblement of taste, and
the impulse of his genius, in order

63
00:04:40.102 --> 00:04:44.924
to rise to greater heights searching for
the ideal and for perfection.

64
00:04:44.924 --> 00:04:50.033
Consequently he has had to sacrifice

65
00:04:50.033 --> 00:04:57.463
his material gains to his
music to his art to his muse.

66
00:04:57.463 --> 00:05:02.271
The artist, again,
who is something above the common herd,

67
00:05:02.271 --> 00:05:07.636
who's cut from a cloth different
from others, Beethoven certainly

68
00:05:07.636 --> 00:05:12.921
held himself in very high esteem
here in 1798 at the age of 28.

69
00:05:12.921 --> 00:05:14.820
Nobody's had ever heard of
Beethoven at this time.

70
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.600
He compares himself already
to the famous von and

71
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.330
the equally famous Frederick Handel.

72
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.470
No lack of self confidence there.

73
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:31.560
1803 he refuses to play for
the King of Prussia, a year or

74
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.900
two later he refused an invitation
to play for the empress in Vienna.

75
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:41.910
He sent her a note back saying I'm busy
today but I might stop by tomorrow.

76
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:46.320
1804, he says to Prince Carl Lichnowsky,

77
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.790
Prince, what you are you
are by accident of birth.

78
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.830
What I am I am through myself.

79
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.620
There have been and
still will be thousands of princes.

80
00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.754
There's only one Beethoven.

81
00:05:59.754 --> 00:06:04.504
But Beethoven didn't realize,
I think, that he owed his talents and

82
00:06:04.504 --> 00:06:07.260
his accomplishments to natural gifts.

83
00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.800
Just like the Prince, to genetics.

84
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.810
Beethoven came from
a long line of musicians.

85
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.880
He was just as much a product of
his birth as was Prince Lichnowsky.

86
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.540
Beethoven was born with absolute pitch and
exceptional musical memory.

87
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.330
He was a child prodigy in Bonn, Germany.

88
00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:32.879
So let's go visit now Beethoven
in Bonn in his youth.
