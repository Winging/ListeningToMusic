2
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.230
Like Mozart and Haydn before him,
Beethoven was not a native of Vienna but

3
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.233
was drawn to the city
because of patronage,

4
00:00:20.233 --> 00:00:24.390
the patronage that Vienna
offered creative musicians.

5
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.100
The aristocracy had
money to spend on music.

6
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.030
And thus many great composers were
lured there, not only for the money but

7
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.160
to test themselves
against the very best and

8
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.730
to learn the latest in
cutting edge high art music.

9
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.170
Beethoven was actually born far
from Vienna in Bonn, Germany,

10
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.290
the other end of the German-speaking
world, as you can see by this map here.

11
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:53.800
Bonn, then with a population of about
20,000, a tenth of that in Vienna,

12
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.710
was then the seat of the elector of Bonn,
one of the nine individuals who go to

13
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.500
vote for,
who got to choose the Holy Roman Emperor.

14
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.690
And the elector of Bonn was actually
a close relative of the emperor back

15
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:08.960
in Vienna.

16
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.770
But Bonn,
although linked to Vienna by blood,

17
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.320
was actually no closer to
Vienna than was Paris.

18
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.320
Beethoven was the son and
grandson of a musician.

19
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.470
His father had come to Bonn
from the low countries.

20
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.610
The family name was van Beethoven,
Flemish and

21
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.220
not von Beethoven, German,
so Flemish not German.

22
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.640
Beethoven always thought
well of his grandfather and

23
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.740
carried this portrait of him
until the end of his days.

24
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.596
In Bonn the Beethovens were employed
as musicians at the Court of Bonn.

25
00:01:41.596 --> 00:01:46.374
And they lived in this house, a quite
respectable, here you see on the left,

26
00:01:46.374 --> 00:01:51.390
the back courtyard, and on the right,
the front of the house as it exists today.

27
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.600
A very respectable dwelling for someone
of the 18th century, today it serves

28
00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.410
also as a museum and a research center for
the life and music of Beethoven's.

29
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:07.260
Beethoven's father, however,
seems to have been something of a tyrant.

30
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:13.400
As we saw, he forced young Beethoven
to practice at all hours of the day,

31
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.280
and the father was something
of disreputable drunkard.

32
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.960
So, Beethoven left.

33
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.870
First he went off to Vienna in 1787,
but was called

34
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.190
back immediately to Bonn by a family
crisis, indeed the death of his mother.

35
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.735
And only later, five years later
in 1792 did the aristocrats of

36
00:02:34.735 --> 00:02:40.700
Bonn put together a purse large enough
to send Beethoven back to Vienna.

37
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:47.710
As one patron said, quote, in fulfillment
of a wish that has long been frustrated.

38
00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.550
Although Mozart's genius
is still in mourning,

39
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.490
you will receive the spirit of
Mozart from the hands of Haydn.

40
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:56.280
So off he goes.

41
00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.710
And Beethoven did study with Haydn, but

42
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.860
Beethoven and
Haydn were temperamentally different.

43
00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.960
Beethoven was probably
temperamentally from everyone.

44
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.300
And Haydn, who was most often in these
years in London, was not a diligent tutor.

45
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:20.750
So Haydn and Beethoven had a very rough,
bumpy teacher-student relationship.

46
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.710
But within a few years,
Beethoven had begun to make it on his own,

47
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.350
make a name for
himself among the well-to-do of Vienna.

48
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:33.000
Essentially, he earned his living from
the sale of his musical compositions.

49
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.460
Quote, I state my price and they,
the publishers, they pay, he said proudly.

50
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.370
And he earned money from
giving a few piano lessons

51
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.740
in the homes of the aristocracy.

52
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.830
But mainly he earned his livelihood from
playing, when invited, at the soirees,

53
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.890
the musical parties in
the homes of the aristocracy.

54
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.220
So, it was mainly in the guise
of a piano virtuoso that

55
00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.880
Beethoven made his mark in Vienna.

56
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.534
As a magazine of the day
said of Beethoven in 1794,

57
00:04:04.534 --> 00:04:07.921
quote, Beethoven, a musical genius,

58
00:04:07.921 --> 00:04:13.500
has chosen Vienna as his residence for
the past two years.

59
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.330
He is widely admired for
the unusual velocity of his playing, and

60
00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.430
is astounding in the way
he masters the most

61
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.460
formidable difficulties
with the greatest of ease.

62
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.190
And that brings us to Beethoven and
his style of piano playing.

63
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.395
Contemporaries said that his
playing moved listeners to cry,

64
00:04:35.395 --> 00:04:38.895
even sob, but
also that it was loud and bombastic.

65
00:04:38.895 --> 00:04:43.165
And he sometimes missed notes and
sometimes broke strings as we learned

66
00:04:43.165 --> 00:04:46.625
from a contemporary musician,
Ignaz Pleyel.

67
00:04:47.625 --> 00:04:52.113
As Pleyel said, and we use as
a backdrop here this this 20th century,

68
00:04:52.113 --> 00:04:57.000
imagine you've seen Beethoven
in the midst of his chaos.

69
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.460
Quote, his playing is NOT clean.

70
00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.255
He has much fire, but
he pounds a bit too much.

71
00:05:01.255 --> 00:05:07.510
He overcomes diabolical difficulties,
but he does not do so neatly.

72
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:08.560
He does not do so neatly.

73
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.619
Well, what might this have sounded like,
Beethoven crashing and

74
00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:14.966
thrashing the piano?

75
00:05:14.966 --> 00:05:21.690
Let's look at Beethoven's
Pathetique Sonata, written in 1797.

76
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.010
Okay, so
here I am back at the keyboard and

77
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.940
will play a bit of this,
the Pathetique Sonata.

78
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.328
Note here the presence of the Latin
word Opus, abbreviated as Op.

79
00:05:34.328 --> 00:05:40.120
Op 13, you see at the top of the image,
under Sonate.

80
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.020
With a composer,
that means the 13th published work

81
00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.380
by that particular composer, work 13.

82
00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:54.190
The term pathetique here,
derives from pathos, with intense feeling.

83
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.630
And this is one of the few
titles that Beethoven himself

84
00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.700
gave to one of his works.

85
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.632
So here we are at the keyboard and
notice in particular here

86
00:06:04.632 --> 00:06:08.975
the extraordinary difference
between the louds and the softs.

87
00:06:08.975 --> 00:06:18.975
[MUSIC]

88
00:06:57.074 --> 00:06:58.725
So we'll stop there.

89
00:06:58.725 --> 00:07:00.699
And you get the point.

90
00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:05.193
All this pounding that we hear here in
the Pathetique Sonata, could it in any way

91
00:07:05.193 --> 00:07:09.286
have been caused by the fact that
Beethoven was having trouble hearing,

92
00:07:09.286 --> 00:07:11.540
that he was going deaf?

93
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.030
Or was this simply his artistic vision?

94
00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.461
This is a question worth exploring.
