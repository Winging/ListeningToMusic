[MUSIC]

2
00:00:11.608 --> 00:00:12.710
What an odd thought.

3
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:13.950
A deaf musician.

4
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.480
Of course, there have been many
blind musicians, Francesco Landini,

5
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.340
Stevie Wonder, Ray Charles,
Blind Tom Wiggins.

6
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.220
But a deaf composer?

7
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.150
That would be like a blind painter.

8
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.390
Of course, Beethoven wasn't born deaf.

9
00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.970
It was an illness that came upon him
gradually, beginning about 1798,

10
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.990
at the age of 28.

11
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.150
Perhaps, even earlier as we'll see.

12
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.670
But for really gifted musicians, this may
not have been quite as fatal as it sounds.

13
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.190
The best musicians can hear
with an inner ear, and

14
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.740
don't need to play on
a keyboard to get inspiration.

15
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.540
They just sit back, and hear, and write.

16
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.150
And that's what Beethoven did.

17
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.730
He could compose anywhere.

18
00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.890
But deafness affected Beethoven's social
life and also his career as a performer.

19
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.810
He couldn't hear how loud he was playing,
and

20
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.270
eventually he stopped playing
in public all together.

21
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.809
As he said to a friend in 1801, I must
confess that I lead a miserable life.

22
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.540
For almost two years now I have ceased to
attend any social function just because

23
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.420
I find it impossible to say to people,
I am deaf.

24
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.330
If I had any other profession I might
be able to cope with my infirmity, but

25
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.320
in my profession it is
a terrible handicap.

26
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.330
A year later, Beethoven commented again
on his deafness in an extraordinary

27
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.780
document called
the Heiligenstadt Testament.

28
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.500
Part last will and testament,
part a cry for understanding.

29
00:01:48.538 --> 00:01:51.580
The Heiligenstadt Testament is so
called because it was written in

30
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.490
the suburb of Vienna of that name,
Heiligenstadt.

31
00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.350
You can take a tram out there,
streetcar, go there today.

32
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.574
And here's that very pleasant looking
abode where Beethoven, tortured by

33
00:02:03.574 --> 00:02:09.713
his sense of growing deafness, was staying
in the late summer, early fall of 1802.

34
00:02:09.713 --> 00:02:13.628
Now here on the screen,
you see the actual document of

35
00:02:13.628 --> 00:02:18.160
the Heiligenstadt Testament
in Beethoven's own hand.

36
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.550
And I'll read an English
translation of this segment of it.

37
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.390
I have always been disposed
to accomplish great deeds.

38
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.050
Well, again, not lacking for
self confidence, our friend Beethoven.

39
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.360
Yet only consider that for 6 years I have
been suffering an incurable affliction.

40
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.210
Well that pushes this all the way
back to about 1796, or so.

41
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.540
Aggravated by imprudent physicians.

42
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.490
Beethoven never thought
much of his doctors.

43
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.620
Year after year deceived
by the hope of improvement.

44
00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.530
Finally forced to contemplate
the prospect of lasting illness.

45
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.340
And then later on further
on into the document,

46
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.230
I would have ended my life,
it was only my art that held me back.

47
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.060
So, perhaps it was more personal
catharsis than anything else,

48
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.180
because Beethoven never actually
published or made public this document.

49
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.560
It was only discovered among his
effects upon his death in 1827.

50
00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.640
What caused Beethoven's death?

51
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.740
Well, I'm really in no position to say,
and

52
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.230
even professional audiologists
can't say with certainty.

53
00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.180
We have only the autopsy to go on, and
yes, they did an autopsy on Beethoven.

54
00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.480
But the autopsy, of course,
shows the result, not the cause.

55
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.300
Well let's take a look at this,
by means of a slide here.

56
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.830
Here you see the external ear on
the left and this critical, for

57
00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.530
Beethoven, center area.

58
00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.240
He suffered from tinnitus and
a distended inner ear,

59
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.360
middle ear here,
that had ossified over time.

60
00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.010
As the autopsy suggests.

61
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:11.520
He lost his capacity to hear high
sounds first about 1812 or so, and

62
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.900
then more or
less completely deaf by 1812,13, 14.

63
00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.790
And what's in question here is the small
bones, the malleus and the incus,

64
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:27.710
that send the sound over to the cochlea
and the basilar membrane inside.

65
00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.060
But more importantly,
how did this affect the music?

66
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.710
Well, difficult to know.

67
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:38.050
But one aspect of the music that we can
still absorb is Beethoven's consistent,

68
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.650
almost obsessive desire to repeat pitches.

69
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.720
Say it again, say it again, again,
again, again, again, and sometimes,

70
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:51.440
this process as music is not pretty or
pleasant.

71
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:58.000
Here's an example from Beethoven's
Fidelio, overture to that opera.

72
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.260
One of the, indeed the only opera
that he wrote of that name, Fidelio.

73
00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.875
Let's listen to again,
a part of the overture to Fidelio.

74
00:05:06.875 --> 00:05:16.875
[MUSIC]

75
00:05:36.842 --> 00:05:38.360
Well, as I say, that's not pretty.

76
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.720
At least it doesn't seem pretty to me.

77
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.510
It's more like someone
being put on a timpani and

78
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.010
being bludgeoned to death
with a timpani stick.

79
00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.140
Was that Beethoven trying
to hear the music?

80
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.710
Make sure that everyone else didn't
miss the point of this crescendo here.

81
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.280
Don't mind my crescendo.

82
00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.740
Don't, don't, don't miss it.

83
00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:01.460
But this is largely
speculation on my part.

84
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.697
Perhaps Beethoven would have created
this reiterative style of music anyway.
