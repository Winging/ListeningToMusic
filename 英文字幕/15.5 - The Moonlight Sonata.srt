[MUSIC]

2
00:00:13.646 --> 00:00:18.386
Despite and possibly in some ways because
of his hearing difficulties, Beethoven

3
00:00:18.386 --> 00:00:23.270
created some remarkable music during
the first decade of the 19th Century.

4
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.450
Let's take a look at
one well-known example,

5
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.310
the Moonlight Sonata, a sonata
written in 1801 and published in 1802,

6
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.320
one of Beethoven's 32 sonatas for piano.

7
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.100
Here's Beethoven working on
the first movement in 1801.

8
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.920
It's a pretty clean score
by Beethoven standards.

9
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.790
But compositionally or creatively,
it may be that in some ways,

10
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.900
this is not all that difficult a piece.

11
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.330
It's more like a song as opposed,
say, to dense counterpoint.

12
00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.550
More like a song, a song without words.

13
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:07.707
So this is the slide of the autographed
of one page of the sketch and

14
00:01:07.707 --> 00:01:12.651
you can see we're about
on into first ten or so

15
00:01:12.651 --> 00:01:16.316
bars of the first movement here.

16
00:01:16.316 --> 00:01:18.143
And here is the title page for

17
00:01:18.143 --> 00:01:22.740
the sonata when it was ultimately
published the next year.

18
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.713
As you can see at the top of this slide,

19
00:01:28.713 --> 00:01:33.954
we have the title there [FOREIGN].

20
00:01:33.954 --> 00:01:35.060
Well that's interesting.

21
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.500
So they were still selling and
people were still playing the harpsichord.

22
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.836
In a mode of a fantasy for
the harpsichord or the piano forte.

23
00:01:46.836 --> 00:01:50.844
So people had started access to
harpsichords in Beethoven's day.

24
00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:52.764
What else it say here?

25
00:01:52.764 --> 00:02:00.018
[FOREIGN].

26
00:02:00.018 --> 00:02:01.559
Well that's the person whom,

27
00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:04.890
the young lady to whom this sonata
was piano sonata was dedicated.

28
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.820
It was the daughter of one of his doctors.

29
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.630
Da, or by, Luigi Van Beethoven.

30
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.900
Luigi Van Beethoven,
Italian is still the dominate language, so

31
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.450
this is all published in Italian.

32
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.730
Opus 27 number two.

33
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.690
But notice that nowhere on this title
page is to be found the word moonlight.

34
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.240
Beethoven didn't give it this name.

35
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.460
A German Romantic poet did later
after he had heard the music and

36
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:40.110
thought that it reminded him of night
with moonlight shining across a lake.

37
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.050
Anyway, here's the score
of the first page.

38
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.790
Okay, so here we are now at the keyboard.

39
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.670
Let me play the first movement
of The Moonlight Sonata.

40
00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:52.731
At least, the beginning.

41
00:02:52.731 --> 00:03:02.731
>> [MUSIC]

42
00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:51.270
We'll stop there.

43
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.530
Okay, what's happened here?

44
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:53.847
Well, we had almost

45
00:03:53.847 --> 00:03:56.076
[MUSIC]

46
00:03:56.076 --> 00:03:59.010
little intro, almost like a pop piece.

47
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.180
A little intro setting the tempo, setting
the mood, and then the melody comes in.

48
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.530
All of this is built of
course on triplet triads.

49
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.192
And finally the melody comes in,
beautiful melody up on top.

50
00:04:12.192 --> 00:04:22.066
[MUSIC]

51
00:04:22.066 --> 00:04:28.260
And notice we started here, but
up above that first star in blue.

52
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.520
We've already modulated to major.

53
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.260
We started with the first star in C minor.

54
00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.930
We modulated by the second star
to the relative major, E major.

55
00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.920
So that's of interest.

56
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.060
What else of interest here.

57
00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.920
Right there, that first blue star and
the first red arrow.

58
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:47.633
Here we're sitting here.

59
00:04:47.633 --> 00:04:54.579
[MUSIC]

60
00:04:54.579 --> 00:04:56.240
Suddenly turns that to minor.

61
00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.170
It's almost as if a cloud
came over the face of a moon.

62
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:03.420
And that's what Beethoven is doing in
this movement, playing off the light and

63
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.810
dark, the major against minor, constantly.

64
00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.620
This is essentially a beautiful
melody built over top of

65
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.830
some very straightforward
supporting triads.

66
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.810
Now, are we hearing those triumphs.

67
00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.330
Are you hearing those triumphs?

68
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.490
Well, let's see, let's turn now to a quiz.

69
00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.712
So, we're going to go on,
we'll set up our quiz sheet here.

70
00:05:25.712 --> 00:05:31.580
I'm going to strip this down to 8
triads that support the melody here.

71
00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.720
And I'll call them out as we go.

72
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.550
And it's your job, and I'm gonna strip
them down to their essence, it's your job

73
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.650
to tell me whether they are a minor
triad or a major triad.

74
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.940
Minor, major.

75
00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.200
May be a little harder then you think.

76
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.490
So let's start out here.

77
00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:51.530
I'll play them.

78
00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.172
Just the triads.

79
00:05:53.172 --> 00:05:56.824
And here we go.

80
00:05:56.824 --> 00:05:58.124

We're gonna check those.

Now here comes major,

123
00:07:38.089 --> 00:07:43.540
minor 2 is minor, 3 is minor.

124
00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:46.530

143

And at this point, this is interesting,
he could have gone right back there.

144
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.590
Beethoven could have gone right back
to his tonic, he's sitting on it,

145
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:03.520
on that dominant and
he could have brought his, could

146
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.920
have brought his melody in.

147
00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:09.820

This is the third system.

149
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:15.730
He continues to hold that
dominant note underneath,

150
00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:18.480
dominant pedal point that
we've experience before.

151
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.247

00:11:07.317 --> 00:11:11.170
It's one that I've been playing for
more years than I care to admit,

185
00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:15.755
but centuries of people have been playing
this, and that's one of the things that

186
00:11:15.755 --> 00:11:20.160
makes this a classic and makes classical
music art, the staying power of art.

187
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:26.034
Okay, well that was the first
movement of the Moonlight Sonata.

188
00:11:26.034 --> 00:11:27.227
Hope you did well on that quiz.

189
00:11:27.227 --> 00:11:31.450
Hope you got at least 50% [LAUGH].

190
00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:34.640
But, this first movement by
Beethoven is a bit unusual here,

191
00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:40.040
because it's written more like a second
movement, a sort of slow, dreamy

192
00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:44.440
second movement, as we would expect the
second movement to be in a piano sonata.

193
00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:49.200
This is one of Beethoven's
noble elegiac slow movements.

194
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.350
The kind of thing that
Beethoven loved to write and

195
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:53.750
the kind of thing that he was famous for.

196
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:58.360
But this first movement of
the Moonlight Sonata is not fast and

197
00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.600
not in sonata allegro
form as we might expect.

198
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:06.130
For a fast sonata allegro form movement
in this sonata, we have to wait for

199
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:10.060
the exciting third and
last movement, the finale.

200
00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:13.130
And it too is something special.

201
00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:15.090
Here's the music for it.

202
00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:15.810
There we go.

203
00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:19.301
We're over to the Finale here.

204
00:12:19.301 --> 00:12:22.469
[MUSIC]

205
00:12:22.469 --> 00:12:27.639
And off it goes, and you can see
basically it's taking this triadic idea,

206
00:12:27.639 --> 00:12:33.140
groups of that we've encountered in
the first movement, this triadic idea and

207
00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:39.050
arpeggios, and extending them upwards,
but now at a lightning pace.

208
00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:40.540
Breakneck pace.

209
00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:44.888
So let's listen to a snippet
of this in a performance by

210
00:12:44.888 --> 00:12:47.638
the pianist Vladimir Ashkenazy.

211
00:12:47.638 --> 00:12:57.638
[MUSIC]

212
00:13:14.424 --> 00:13:17.170
Okay, let's phase this down.

213
00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:21.170
It was at that moment that I knew,
when I was 18 years old,

214
00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:22.980
that I was never gonna
be a concert pianist.

215
00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:26.260
I could never play this really up
to tempo the way it should go.

216
00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.640
As we've heard here with Vladimir
Ashkenazy, the playing was very fast and

217
00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:31.390
very clean.

218
00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:32.780
But notice at once point,

219
00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:37.370
he put in a little bit of retard to help
give the music a sense of definition and

220
00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:41.640
form in his performance and
not all pianists do this.

221
00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.880
They worry about
the technical aspect of this.

222
00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:48.970
They have to wrestle so hard with
the technical and not the expressive.

223
00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:53.305
Here's a very mechanical, sort of
unexpressive performance that you can find

224
00:13:53.305 --> 00:13:56.676
on YouTube, but it's fun to
watch because of the animation.

225
00:13:59.421 --> 00:14:09.421
[MUSIC]

226
00:14:12.843 --> 00:14:19.511
So again here, the tempo is hugely fast,
but it's almost machine like.

227
00:14:19.511 --> 00:14:21.280
And actually,

228
00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:27.140
this movement's a good one to focus on
to discuss the issue of expression and

229
00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:32.450
a performer's interpretation on
the music the composer has created.

230
00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:38.100
Let's watch the beginning of another
performance of the same piece,

231
00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.760
this one by Valentina Zitza.

232
00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:44.020
The performance you'll about
to see has been viewed,

233
00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:48.610
enjoyed by more than 7
million people worldwide.

234
00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:52.465
Anyway, as you watch her performance,
what is she fore-grounding here?

235
00:14:52.465 --> 00:14:56.557
Is it technique or expression, or both?

236
00:14:56.557 --> 00:15:06.557
[MUSIC]

237
00:15:49.122 --> 00:15:50.045

>> [MUSIC]

246
00:16:24.323 --> 00:16:27.490
>> And this leads us back to
the repeat of exposition.

247
00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:28.840
So, we're going to stop it there.

248
00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.120
So, what'd you think of that?

249
00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.560
Sure is fast.

250
00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:36.040
Is this technique or expression and
how do we recognize expression?

251
00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:39.530
How does a performer create expression.

252
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:43.640
Well, by louds and softs and
by diminuendo and crescendos and

253
00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:48.240
especially by variation in tempo,
retards and accelerandos.

254
00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:53.360
So again technique, just in a sense
how fast it goes, versus expression.

255
00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:59.210
Expression being personal interpretation,
constantly tweaking the music,

256
00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:00.710
if you will.

257
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:06.020
How does a performer play with our
expectations of the musical score?

258
00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:08.120
That's a lot that's involved here.

259
00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:13.620
How can our expectations be
brought into this and then be

260
00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:20.070
extended in an exciting sort of way to
make the interpretation very personal.

261
00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:24.061
Well, here's another performer,
American pianist Mark Solman,

262
00:17:24.061 --> 00:17:27.032
what do you think here,
technique or expression?

263
00:17:27.032 --> 00:17:37.032
[MUSIC]

264
00:17:38.571 --> 00:17:43.363

266
00:17:58.113 --> 00:18:03.390

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:06.031

to the return exposition yet again.

286
00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:16.430
Well, which did you like better?

287
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:18.090
They were very different.

288
00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:20.948
I'll give you a moment to
think about it and tell me.

289
00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:25.725
Now, it's my turn.

290
00:19:25.725 --> 00:19:30.300
[INAUDIBLE] is playing with technically
dazzling and she kept the tempo right now

291
00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:35.990
beat She gets through this exposition in
exactly one minute and thirty seconds.

292
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:40.750
But didn't allow for, that speed perhaps,
didn't allow for much opportunity for

293
00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:42.045
interpretive freedom.

294
00:19:42.045 --> 00:19:46.170
[INAUDIBLE] playing, on the other hand,
well maybe had a little bit too much pedal

295
00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:49.460
at the beginning, at least for
my taste, a little bit muddy.

296
00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:51.830
But you can't say that it wasn't creative.

297
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:53.315
He buried the tempos.

298
00:19:53.315 --> 00:19:59.620
He actually takes 14 seconds longer to
get through the same music than did and

299
00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:06.770
the dynamic's very abnormal, so
as to tell the listener what

300
00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:11.370
he thought this piece was all about, what
he wanted us to feel about this piece.

301
00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:15.510
His performance was a bit more romantic,
more freedom for the interpreter.

302
00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:20.250
Well, how would Beethoven
have played his own creation?

303
00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:21.700
Course we'll never know.

304
00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:27.350
He'd might actually, however, have been
perhaps closer to Zelman's interpretation.

305
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:31.250
Given all that was said by
Beethoven's contemporaries about his

306
00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:36.340
wild swings of emotion and
his crashing and thrashing at the piano.

307
00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:39.710
But does it matter how
Beethoven played this movement?

308
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:43.560
Isn't the important thing
how we hear it in our mind?

309
00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:45.630
How we want to hear it?

310
00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:50.648
Which is more important,
the creator or you or

311
00:20:50.648 --> 00:20:55.040
I, the listener is creativity and art.

312
00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:59.740
Is it not about change and changing our
understanding of the human experience.

313
00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:02.670
Maybe you, the listener,
are the most important thing here.

314
00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:06.360
you can make of this whatever you wish.

315
00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:08.929
That's one of the wonderful
things about art.

316
00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:15.640
So now, to give us a chance to unwind
here at the end of our session,

317
00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.820
after this exciting performance,
let me play on a good Stanley,

318
00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:22.310
another example of the elegiac sound.

319
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:24.450
Much like the first movement
in the Moonlight Sonata,

320
00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:28.860
the elegiac sound of Beethoven,
the sort of hymn-like sound of Beethoven.

321
00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:33.340
This is from the beginning of the slow
movement of the Arch Duke Trio.

322
00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:39.470
Which takes us into the music
of Beethoven's heroic period.

323
00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:44.920
So, here's a little encore, the slow
movement of Beethoven's Archduke Trio.

324
00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:48.072
We'll hear the beginning and
then fade out.

325
