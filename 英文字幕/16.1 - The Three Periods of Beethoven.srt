[MUSIC]

2
00:00:23.927 --> 00:00:28.250
In the last session we explored
Beethoven's music primarily, from his so

3
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.691
called, early period,

4
00:00:29.691 --> 00:00:35.110
up to 1803 with Beethoven working
very much within the classical style.

5
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.930
Today we'll engage Beethoven, as he begins
to create what we call his heroic music,

6
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.440
our earliest soundings of romantic music.

7
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.230
We'll also hear a bit of music
from Beethoven's late period.

8
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.490
But why these periods?

9
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.480
Or units of time with Beethoven,
early, middle and late?

10
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.580
Do we think that way in
terms of other composers?

11
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.720
Do we talk about the early period or
late period of Bach or Mozart or

12
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.970
Heiden or Wagner?

13
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.750
No, generally not.

14
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.800
So Beethoven stands out.

15
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.680
He's unusual in the history
of music in this regard.

16
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.430
But what specifically are these
periods with Beethoven?

17
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.430
Well as you can see,
it's very straight forward here.

18
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.750
Early period, from his first compositions.

19
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.950
1792 up until 1802, 1803 he writes the,

20
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.600
Heroic Symphony, as we will see continues
to 1812, culminating in the 7th symphony.

21
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.040
And then, in the late Period,
not as much composition from Beethoven but

22
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.900
again we come back to big pieces such as
the Missa solemnis and the Ninth Symphony

23
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.520
and most particularly, the late piano
sonatas and the late string quartets.

24
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.440
Let's review what Beethoven sounded
like in 1800 to set a benchmark, for

25
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.680
what a revolutionary transformation he
underwent in just three short years.

26
00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.250
Let's listen to a bit of the first
movement of Beethoven's symphony

27
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.010
number one.

28
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.745
We'll watch a wonderful group
of young performers, Israeli and

29
00:02:07.745 --> 00:02:12.401
Palestinian, making music together
under the organization and

30
00:02:12.401 --> 00:02:15.038
baton of maestro Daniel Baronborn.

31
00:02:15.038 --> 00:02:19.585
This will also give us a chance to
review Sonata allegro form, and

32
00:02:19.585 --> 00:02:21.250
I'll comment as we go.

33
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.882
[MUSIC]

34
00:02:25.882 --> 00:02:29.957
First theme.

35
00:02:29.957 --> 00:02:31.106
First theme up a step.

36
00:02:31.106 --> 00:02:32.708
[MUSIC]

37
00:02:32.708 --> 00:02:38.014
Led out by the violins.

38
00:02:38.014 --> 00:02:41.613
And back down to the of that first theme.

39
00:02:41.613 --> 00:02:49.681
[MUSIC]

40
00:02:49.681 --> 00:02:50.297
Transition.

41
00:02:50.297 --> 00:02:58.934
[MUSIC]

42
00:02:58.934 --> 00:03:00.049
Going up the scale.

43
00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:07.363
[MUSIC]

44
00:03:07.363 --> 00:03:10.856
Hayden's coming up right there.

45
00:03:10.856 --> 00:03:13.748
[MUSIC]

46
00:03:13.748 --> 00:03:16.239
Second theme played out by the woodwinds.

47
00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:23.135
[MUSIC]

48
00:03:23.135 --> 00:03:28.708
Now dialogue between strings, and
woodwinds with that second theme.

49
00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:32.478
[MUSIC]

50
00:03:32.478 --> 00:03:34.335
Okay, and that gives us an idea.

51
00:03:34.335 --> 00:03:35.171
[MUSIC]

52
00:03:35.171 --> 00:03:38.080
All this sounds very much like Mozart.

53
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.660
And keep in mind that Beethoven was no
prodigy as a composer of symphonies.

54
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.930
He was 30 when he wrote
this first symphony.

55
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.950
Mozart died when he was 35,
that's how brightly his star burned.

56
00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.550
Now let's listen to an audio clip from the
finale of Beethoven's Symphony number 3

57
00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.990
to hear just how quickly and radically
Beethoven's symphonic style changed.

58
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.675
Remember, only three years later
here is Symphony number 3.

59
00:04:05.675 --> 00:04:08.232
But the sound is very different.

60
00:04:08.232 --> 00:04:16.510
[MUSIC]

61
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.217
So you hear the brasses.

62
00:04:18.217 --> 00:04:21.351
[MUSIC]

63
00:04:21.351 --> 00:04:27.342
You hear the slow,
majestic unfolding of the theme.

64
00:04:27.342 --> 00:04:37.930
[MUSIC]

65
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.885
Well that's the he, heroic sound of
Beethoven that we first hear here in

66
00:04:42.885 --> 00:04:46.790
Symphony number 3,
subtitled now the Eroica.

67
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.970
And it does sound very heroic, big,
powerful, grand, and glorious.

68
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.634
In our next segment we'll explore how
the symphony got it's name Eroica and

69
00:04:57.634 --> 00:05:01.099
how Beethoven created
this new heroic sound.
