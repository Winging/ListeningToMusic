00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:06.958
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:06.958 --> 00:00:13.475
The story of the Eroica goes back as
you may know, to the Neopolianic wars.

3
00:00:13.475 --> 00:00:18.285
In the 1790s young
Consul Napoleon Bonaparte had taken over

4
00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:23.005
the French government, and built a huge
war machine that quickly overran Italy and

5
00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:26.065
then the German speaking Rhineland.

6
00:00:26.065 --> 00:00:30.055
Because in theory Napoleon represented
a continuation of the values of

7
00:00:30.055 --> 00:00:34.900
the French Revolution, [FOREIGN].

8
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.250
Beethoven was much taken with
his libertarian young hero,

9
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.260
Napoleon, seen here in the famous
portrait by Jacque-Louis David.

10
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:50.210
Napoleon Crossing The Alps, and
they had both much in common.

11
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.220
Napoleon and Beethoven were,

12
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.448
revolutionary figures in that they
detested the aristocracy and it's power.

13
00:00:58.448 --> 00:01:02.040
So in 1802-1803, Beethoven was working on

14
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.830
a new symphony with Napoleon in mind,
and pretty much had finished it.

15
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.550
But when word came that Napoleon
had given himself a promotion and

16
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.420
declared himself emperor, well,
here we see the newly crowned

17
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.830
emperor painted by Jean Auguste Ingres and

18
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.410
needless to say, Beethoven was not pleased
with this development in his mind,

19
00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.330
one tyrannical ruler had
just replaced another.

20
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.300
So in a fit of rage, he took a knife
to the page of this third symphony and

21
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.360
scratched out Napoleon's
name from the title,

22
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.470
as you can see here originally it was,
[FOREIGN] Luigi van Beethoven.

23
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:51.170
But where Bonaparte was,
now, there is just a hole.

24
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.440
Eventually he retitled the symphony for
a fallen hero.

25
00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.610
A hero had clearly fallen certainly
in Beethoven's estimation.

26
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.300
When the work was published in 1806
as we see here the word Eroica,

27
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.550
is prominent at the top.

28
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.720
[FOREIGN] Which grand man
at this point isn't clear.

29
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.570
And just to finish the story of Napoleon
and Beethoven, Napoleon did invade Austria

30
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:31.430
and captured Vienna twice during
Beethoven's time in 1805 and in 1809.

31
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.469
During most of these years Beethoven was
living here, at the Pasqualati House.

32
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.020
Which happened to be on
the ramparts of the old fortress.

33
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.900
So, when Napoleon unleashed his hundreds
of cannons at the old city fortresses,

34
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.100
well, Beethoven had a ringside seat.

35
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.400
And although he was nearly deaf,
he was terrified by the sound and

36
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.180
the destruction of the cannons.

37
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.980
Well anyway enough about Beethoven and
Napoleon let's get to the music.

38
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.630
To do so we'll start with the opening
sounds of the Aurora Symphony.

39
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:13.200
Let's see whats revolutionary about it
as we listen you Identify three things,

40
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.240
three ways that in which this music
differs from Mozart or Haydn.

41
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.420
What is Beethoven doing here, that
Mozart for example would not have done?

42
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.378
And here again we're going
to employ a video made by

43
00:03:27.378 --> 00:03:31.575
Steve Malinowski two hammer strokes
right at the beginning, and

44
00:03:31.575 --> 00:03:36.431
then the theme appears not in the first
violins we would expect but in the chello.

45
00:03:36.431 --> 00:03:47.204
[MUSIC]

46
00:03:47.204 --> 00:03:51.512
Now the woodwinds take over the theme.

47
00:03:51.512 --> 00:03:53.543
Takes it up a step.

48
00:03:53.543 --> 00:03:54.413
Up another step

49
00:03:54.413 --> 00:03:57.187
[MUSIC]

50
00:03:57.187 --> 00:03:59.811
Now we get ready for
some heavy handed syncopation

51
00:03:59.811 --> 00:04:05.049
[MUSIC]

52
00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:05.849
More syncopation.

53
00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:07.823
[MUSIC]

54
00:04:07.823 --> 00:04:09.808
Now everybody in full orchestra.

55
00:04:09.808 --> 00:04:19.808
[MUSIC]

56
00:04:23.265 --> 00:04:26.440
Well that's just a peek at the first
movement here, of the Eroica.

57
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.940
The second movement is unusual too,

58
00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.530
it's a funeral march,
Marche Funebre, as the title says.

59
00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.810
You can think of Napoleon here as
the person for whom we have a funeral, or

60
00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:44.080
perhaps any of those who died in
battle during these Napoleonic Wars.

61
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.566
And the sound is indeed funereal,

62
00:04:46.566 --> 00:04:50.861
it's in a plotting C minor let
me play a bit at the keyboard.

63
00:04:50.861 --> 00:05:00.861
[MUSIC]

64
00:05:23.374 --> 00:05:28.358
With the finale of this symphony,
we return to the triadic theme,

65
00:05:28.358 --> 00:05:34.100
under a slightly different guise,
and here it is on the screen.

66
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.059
Melodies up on the top also the triad.

67
00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:47.059
[MUSIC]

68
00:05:48.343 --> 00:05:52.581
There's our major triad up there and
there's a baseline underneath.

69
00:05:52.581 --> 00:06:02.600
[MUSIC]

70
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.355
So Beethoven has two
themes operating here,

71
00:06:05.355 --> 00:06:08.480
he's got a double theme and variation.

72
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.920
Sometimes he bury, varies the base,

73
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:15.550
sometimes he varies the more
ingratiating melody up on top.

74
00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:20.180
Eventually, Beethoven turns this
lovely melody into a version for

75
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.840
five woodwind parts,
that we've heard before.

76
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:24.525
Let's review this.

77
00:06:24.525 --> 00:06:28.727
[MUSIC]

78
00:06:28.727 --> 00:06:31.025
So here's the theme now and the woodwinds.

79
00:06:31.025 --> 00:06:33.347
[MUSIC]

80
00:06:33.347 --> 00:06:34.903
Mostly oboe playing the melody.

81
00:06:34.903 --> 00:06:36.691
[MUSIC]

82
00:06:36.691 --> 00:06:39.129
This seems the counter point.

83
00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:40.730
Clarionets the filler in the middle.

84
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:49.089
[MUSIC]

85
00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:49.669
Horn comes in.

86
00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:58.621
[MUSIC]

87
00:06:58.621 --> 00:07:03.624
And towards the end of this movement,
Beethoven expands his melody into a grand,

88
00:07:03.624 --> 00:07:09.380
triumphant sound, again foregrounding the
sound of the triads played by the brasses.

89
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:12.150
In this case, the blaring French horn so

90
00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:18.100
triads, loud volume,
full brasses, major key.

91
00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.847
These are the things that make
Beethoven's music sound heroic.

92
00:07:21.847 --> 00:07:31.847
[MUSIC]

93
00:07:38.844 --> 00:07:41.563
And you can hear the brasses,
particularly French horns and

94
00:07:41.563 --> 00:07:42.850
trumpets that you see here.

95
00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:46.007
[MUSIC]

96
00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:50.802
All unfolding majestically and
rather slowly.

97
00:07:50.802 --> 00:08:00.802
[MUSIC]

98
00:08:03.416 --> 00:08:04.878
Pulling up into the time

99
00:08:04.878 --> 00:08:14.878
[MUSIC]

100
00:08:16.756 --> 00:08:17.524
Very grand indeed.

101
00:08:17.524 --> 00:08:23.340
So that's the triumphant climax of
the finale of the Eroica Symphony.

102
00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:28.110
Let's review what's special,
indeed revolutionary about it and

103
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:31.530
the heroic style of Beethoven generally.

104
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:38.260
As you can see here, it begins with
some opening hammer strokes dum, dum.

105
00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.665
Then a triadic theme at the beginning.

106
00:08:39.665 --> 00:08:45.342
[MUSIC]

107
00:08:45.342 --> 00:08:49.311
The orchestration is a bit unusual in
the sense that we have the main theme,

108
00:08:49.311 --> 00:08:51.642
actually rather down low in the chello,
and

109
00:08:51.642 --> 00:08:54.790
we don't hear much from the first violin.

110
00:08:54.790 --> 00:09:00.540
Toward the end of that passage that we
heard, the brasses are foreground and

111
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.120
the full orchestra plays prominently.

112
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:07.930
The slow fashion which this unfolds,

113
00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:12.210
generally extends the length of
the symphonic movements by Beethoven.

114
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:15.590
Here you can see that the total symphony
would take the eroi, it would take

115
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:21.540
about 45 minutes, compared to roughly
25 for a symphony of Haydn or Mozart.

116
00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:25.420
All of this again is caused by
the slowing down of the presentation of

117
00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:30.930
the melodic ideas but an uptick,
building up of the volume.

118
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:34.480
Well what we just heard
a moment ago was the end,

119
00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:38.430
of toward the end of the Eroica
symphony of Beethoven.

120
00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:41.931
But we're only here at
the beginning of our exploration of

121
00:09:41.931 --> 00:09:43.793
Beethoven's heroic period.
