1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:16.117 --> 00:00:18.137
Probably the most famous moment.

3
00:00:18.137 --> 00:00:20.006
The motive in all classic music,

4
00:00:20.006 --> 00:00:23.222
is the beginning of
Beethoven's Symphony Number Five.

5
00:00:23.222 --> 00:00:26.239
[MUSIC]

6
00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:31.182
Likely, the only thing that's
equivalent to it in western culture,

7
00:00:31.182 --> 00:00:35.562
is the line, To be or not to be,
from Shakespeare's Hamlet.

8
00:00:35.562 --> 00:00:39.280
And in the that is what symphony is about.

9
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.060
What is it to be or
not to be this symphony?

10
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.454
Beethoven is reputed
to have said about it,

11
00:00:47.454 --> 00:00:52.100
well, it's fate [SOUND]
knocking at the door.

12
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.650
How did Beethoven respond to fate?

13
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:55.310
How did he act?

14
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.030
Well, aggressively and emphatically and

15
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.720
judging ultimately from the final
chords of this symphony triumphantly.

16
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.450
This symphony has the general feeling
of struggle, Beethoven's struggle,

17
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.520
the struggle of all of us,
against the forces of nature.

18
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.190
Maybe against the forces of human nature.

19
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.720
From an uncertain beginning
to a triumphant end.

20
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.765
Symphony number five was premiered
in Vienna on a bitterly cold night,

21
00:01:24.765 --> 00:01:29.140
22nd of December 1808 along
with his sixth symphony and

22
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.570
other compositions in a concert
that lasted four hours.

23
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.070
Beethoven had organized it and
had the audience sit there freezing for

24
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.350
four hours in an unheated theater.

25
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.930
But in the sense Beethoven didn't
care much about audience comfort,

26
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.100
he just cared about the music.

27
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.940
Here's the outside of the theatre.

28
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.180
Beethoven actually lived upstairs
in this theatre for a while.

29
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.980
And here's the inside of it as it looks
today, and here's the theatre as it looks.

30
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.020
In Beethoven's day,
you can see down there at the bottom,

31
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.010
right at bottom left you can
see the orches, orchestral pit.

32
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.060
Immediately up above that is
the emperor's box, with the red curtains.

33
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.220
On the stage, well, lo and
behold, we see horses.

34
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.030
This was something akin to
Radio City Musical Hall in New York City.

35
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.040
It was an entertainment performance space.

36
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.750
Again, this is where Beethoven's famous
Symphony number 5 was premiered in 1808,

37
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.770
and here's the autograph of
the opening page of that symphony.

38
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.840
Now, I know it's difficult to see this,
but

39
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.770
if you look to,
let me see if I can use the pointer.

40
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.290
Here we go, here we've got some of
the the string parts up here and you

41
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.050
can see the three short values that you're
familiar with in and it goes over to here.

42
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.030
The long note with a fermata.

43
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.010
So you can see it's not a very
economical use of this space here.

44
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.610
All right, now,
we're going to examine this Symphony.

45
00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.560
But first, just a bit of music theory.

46
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.580
We all know about the short, short,

47
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.910
short, long rhythmic motif,
that predominates here.

48
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.660
But there's something else,
a diminished triad.

49
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.720
Now in music of course, we have major
triads and we have minor triads.

50
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.186
There's also a third kind of a triad,
called a diminished triad.

51
00:03:21.186 --> 00:03:25.570
It's made up of only minor thirds.

52
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.050
So let's play a major triad.

53
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.588
[SOUND] There's a major triad, now I'm
just going to lower the middle note there.

54
00:03:31.588 --> 00:03:32.819
[SOUND] That makes a minor.

55
00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.197
Triad but supposing I lower
both middle and top note?

56
00:03:36.197 --> 00:03:37.811
[SOUND] Well, I get that.

57
00:03:37.811 --> 00:03:40.230
And that's a diminished tri, triad.

58
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.030
I can e, add one more minor third up
there on top, I get a diminished seventh.

59
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.680
It's a tension building chord.

60
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:52.900
And we can take this when it comes in
rising sequence, it's full of tension.

61
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.200
Okay, talk now probably oh, I don't know,

62
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.800
five, six, seven minutes about this,
about this particular symphony.

63
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.230
And let me get my glasses on to do so.

64
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.460
So you know the beginning.

65
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:07.540
We start this way.

66
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.000
I'm working off of what's called just
a piano score of the full score.

67
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.450
Piano, two hand version of the full score.

68
00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.792
[MUSIC]

69
00:04:18.792 --> 00:04:19.683
We would expect it to go.

70
00:04:19.683 --> 00:04:22.224
[MUSIC]

71
00:04:22.224 --> 00:04:23.560
So it's an odd beginning.

72
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.718
[MUSIC]

73
00:04:26.718 --> 00:04:31.013
Sort of that punch in the nose of that
theme, but it never gets resolved.

74
00:04:31.013 --> 00:04:32.441
He moves away from it.

75
00:04:32.441 --> 00:04:42.441
[MUSIC]

76
00:04:48.335 --> 00:04:50.366
We have a pause there and
then it starts out again.

77
00:04:50.366 --> 00:04:53.744
[MUSIC]

78
00:04:53.744 --> 00:04:55.022
And then we have the descent.

79
00:04:55.022 --> 00:05:01.279
[MUSIC]

80
00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:05.485
Building, coming down, just on the
diminished chord again, diminished sound.

81
00:05:05.485 --> 00:05:08.666
Then eventually he works that through,
builds up a little climax.

82
00:05:08.666 --> 00:05:10.683
[MUSIC]

83
00:05:10.683 --> 00:05:11.902
This is transition.

84
00:05:11.902 --> 00:05:18.253
[MUSIC]

85
00:05:18.253 --> 00:05:19.553
Top of that transition line.

86
00:05:19.553 --> 00:05:21.910
[MUSIC]

87
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.069
Then this chord, major chord.

88
00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:27.784
And then this chord,
which is another presentation of our.

89
00:05:27.784 --> 00:05:31.000
[MUSIC]

90
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.567
Diminish chord until we reach.

91
00:05:32.567 --> 00:05:33.321
[MUSIC]

92
00:05:33.321 --> 00:05:38.209
Pause, and then we have our short,
short, short, long.

93
00:05:38.209 --> 00:05:40.531
[MUSIC]

94
00:05:40.531 --> 00:05:41.530
But then, he extends it by two notes.

95
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.318
[MUSIC]

96
00:05:43.318 --> 00:05:47.242
And he uses that as a modulation
into the second theme.

97
00:05:47.242 --> 00:05:50.098
[MUSIC]

98
00:05:50.098 --> 00:05:52.752
Now the second theme,
as is usually the case,

99
00:05:52.752 --> 00:05:55.415
is lyrical, sort of sweet,
tender sounding.

100
00:05:55.415 --> 00:06:05.415
[MUSIC]

101
00:06:08.425 --> 00:06:12.089
But did you ever notice, and it takes
a good conductor to make this come out,

102
00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:13.987
what the basses are doing underneath?

103
00:06:13.987 --> 00:06:16.158
[MUSIC]

104
00:06:16.158 --> 00:06:18.603
So we have a little counterpoint,
it's like the Jaws theme,

105
00:06:18.603 --> 00:06:21.719
every time you think it's safe to come
out of the water, lurking underneath.

106
00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:23.065
[MUSIC]

107
00:06:23.065 --> 00:06:23.762
Is that motif.

108
00:06:23.762 --> 00:06:33.762
[MUSIC]

109
00:06:36.079 --> 00:06:40.630
After the second theme he builds up
through rising melodic sequence.

110
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:46.284
[MUSIC]

111
00:06:46.284 --> 00:06:50.824
Continues to build off of that
up until the point way up here.

112
00:06:50.824 --> 00:06:54.712
[MUSIC]

113
00:06:54.712 --> 00:06:56.303
And then finally, when he resolves that.

114
00:06:56.303 --> 00:07:03.965
[MUSIC]

115
00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:04.790
Concluding theme.

116
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:12.115
[MUSIC]

117
00:07:12.115 --> 00:07:15.360
And that takes us to
the end of trhe exposition.

118
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:20.570
The development begins in a odd way,
but developments often do.

119
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:21.342
Begins this fashion.

120
00:07:21.342 --> 00:07:25.730
[MUSIC]

121
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:29.580
A very dissonant interval
is encountered right there.

122
00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:32.110
But it only gives us that at
the beginning of the development section.

123
00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.860
It's like holding up a sign saying
disruption is coming our way.

124
00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.110
We are in a new section.

125
00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:39.385
And he works through this section.

126
00:07:39.385 --> 00:07:44.656
[MUSIC]

127
00:07:44.656 --> 00:07:48.002
And so on and
then takes us through a series of

128
00:07:48.002 --> 00:07:51.807
modulations modulating to there and
then again.

129
00:07:51.807 --> 00:07:54.896
[MUSIC]

130
00:07:54.896 --> 00:07:56.370
To a new key here.

131
00:07:56.370 --> 00:08:00.225
So we're moving along, modulating, and the
he starts to build up this sound again.

132
00:08:00.225 --> 00:08:10.225
[MUSIC]

133
00:08:21.911 --> 00:08:24.050
Well, that was a very strange moment.

134
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:26.270
Strange on a, on a number of counts.

135
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:29.370
Here we are right in the epicenter
of the entire movement.

136
00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:33.080
Right in the dead middle of
the development section, and

137
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.565
we're sitting here playing
this kind of chord.

138
00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:45.110
Almost as if we've been electrocuted by
the, the rhythmic energy of this piece.

139
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:48.290
But at the same time,
it's a compression of this energy.

140
00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:51.260
We're doing to just one note,
instead of short, short long.

141
00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.710
Maybe it's just short, short,
short, everything is short.

142
00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:58.980
And of course the tension is cause
here by, we've got this chord,

143
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:02.760
diminished cord and then diminished chord.

144
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.550
This is a radically different sound.

145
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:09.785
Just 15 or so years earlier, we would have
heard from Mozart this sort of thing.

146
00:09:09.785 --> 00:09:13.895
[MUSIC]

147
00:09:13.895 --> 00:09:18.168
A.
[MUSIC]

148
00:09:18.168 --> 00:09:19.773
That's what the audience expected and

149
00:09:19.773 --> 00:09:21.580
instead of that they
get this sort of sound.

150
00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:25.644
[MUSIC]

151
00:09:25.644 --> 00:09:28.732
They must have thought Beethoven
was nuts at that particular,

152
00:09:28.732 --> 00:09:30.440
at that particular moment.

153
00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.160
Well, that's the epicenter
of the movement.

154
00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.160
Then he begins to back off of it.

155
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.287
The music becomes quieter
becomes more consonant.

156
00:09:38.287 --> 00:09:48.287
[MUSIC]

157
00:09:49.304 --> 00:09:51.289
Just moving his motive
through different keys.

158
00:09:51.289 --> 00:09:57.199
[MUSIC]

159
00:09:57.199 --> 00:09:59.904
And now he reduces that transition motive.

160
00:09:59.904 --> 00:10:01.119
[MUSIC]

161
00:10:01.119 --> 00:10:06.901
Richard took four and
sometimes six pitches, down to just two.

162
00:10:06.901 --> 00:10:15.839
One, two, one, two, one, two, one.

163
00:10:15.839 --> 00:10:21.680
[MUSIC]

164
00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.500
Now just down to one,
because it's just at the octave.

165
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:28.450
Here's a new one, but one, one, one.

166
00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:32.260
So he's reduced the whole thing
really down to just one sound.

167
00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.899
At this point the orchestra
wants to get back in.

168
00:10:34.899 --> 00:10:38.741
[MUSIC]

169
00:10:38.741 --> 00:10:41.600
But that one note won't
let it back into it.

170
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.820
It keeps repeating again and
again and again.

171
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:45.354
Finally.

172
00:10:45.354 --> 00:10:51.309
[MUSIC]

173
00:10:51.309 --> 00:10:53.422
The orchestra more or
less breaks down the door.

174
00:10:53.422 --> 00:10:57.288
[MUSIC]

175
00:10:57.288 --> 00:10:58.994
To get back in.

176
00:10:58.994 --> 00:11:01.909
And it does get back in
with the main theme.

177
00:11:01.909 --> 00:11:11.909
[MUSIC]

178
00:11:18.453 --> 00:11:20.310
Now something very strange happens.

179
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:21.897
[MUSIC]

180
00:11:21.897 --> 00:11:24.095
Right in the middle of all
this tension with this.

181
00:11:24.095 --> 00:11:25.858
[MUSIC]

182
00:11:25.858 --> 00:11:28.250
Lovely oboe solo.

183
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:30.440
An oboe cadenza, what's he doing?

184
00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:35.030
I think what he's doing here is trying
to release all of this tension that

185
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:38.480
has been built up in the,
in the development section.

186
00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:42.100
When I was a kid, my mother to cook on
something called a pressure cooker.

187
00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:45.940
I don't know if they have anymore, but
you'd put all this meat in there and

188
00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:49.240
you'd turn up the heat, and
there'd be this valve up on top.

189
00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:53.420
And if you didn't loosen that valve,
that thing would blow up.

190
00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:57.740
And one time it did blow up, it blew up
all over my mother's kitchen ceiling.

191
00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:00.180
Because that release
valve wasn't turned on.

192
00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:02.743
So this is a, a sort of musical moment.

193
00:12:02.743 --> 00:12:06.946
[MUSIC]

194
00:12:06.946 --> 00:12:10.719
Where Beethoven is just letting the
tension out and then he will pick it up.

195
00:12:10.719 --> 00:12:16.036
[MUSIC]

196
00:12:16.036 --> 00:12:18.709
[NOISE] With a chord below it, but

197
00:12:18.709 --> 00:12:24.058
again it's that tension filled
diminished chord underneath.

198
00:12:24.058 --> 00:12:28.403
Well, that's a bit of these first
movements, and of the ideas of

199
00:12:28.403 --> 00:12:34.230
the first movement here of the fifth
symphony, it's filled with intensity.

200
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:39.901
It's filled with anxiety, because of
the diminished triad, because of the,

201
00:12:39.901 --> 00:12:45.076
of the insistent [SOUND] rhythmic
motor and also because of compression.

202
00:12:45.076 --> 00:12:47.247
This is actually,
although it's very intense,

203
00:12:47.247 --> 00:12:50.600
this is actually a very short
movement by Beethoven's standards.

204
00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:56.560
This combination of compression,
intensity, and

205
00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:01.520
insistence of the rhythmic motive
that makes this movement exceptional.

206
00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:09.630
The second movement begins in
a diametrically opposed way,

207
00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:13.570
with a long, lyrical,
lovely theme in the strings.

208
00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:18.520
But soon the brasses enter with
a contrasting heroic theme.

209
00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:23.401
And again, we hear here that short,
short, short, long idea.

210
00:13:23.401 --> 00:13:31.217
[MUSIC]

211
00:13:31.217 --> 00:13:32.888
Short, short, short long.

212
00:13:32.888 --> 00:13:42.888
[MUSIC]

213
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:52.521
All played by the brasses which once
more makes it sound very heroic.

214
00:13:52.521 --> 00:13:57.028
Now, Beethoven does something use,
unusual here with regard to the third and

215
00:13:57.028 --> 00:13:58.430
fourth movements.

216
00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:03.080
He links the third movement to
the fourth movement by means of I,

217
00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:05.710
a gigantic crescendo.

218
00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:08.200
A Beethovenian swell as it's called,

219
00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.230
though maybe we should call
it a Beethovenian tsunami.

220
00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:19.010
It's entirely made up of the same pitches,
and

221
00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:22.950
these pitches continue to turn,
or continue to twist.

222
00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:23.970
They circle around.

223
00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:27.871
[MUSIC]

224
00:14:27.871 --> 00:14:33.518
And then gradually the pitches raise
a little bit as the volume raises until

225
00:14:33.518 --> 00:14:39.086
we have this gigantic swell, this great
wave of sound come over top of us.

226
00:14:39.086 --> 00:14:49.086
[MUSIC]

227
00:15:17.058 --> 00:15:22.572
Brasses are in at the top of the line.

228
00:15:22.572 --> 00:15:23.990
With the triadic theme.

229
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:28.170
[MUSIC]

230
00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:29.940
And on it goes.

231
00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:31.750
Eventually, because this movement,

232
00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:35.610
indeed this symphony,
has taken several surprising turns,

233
00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:40.210
at the end Beethoven must prove that
he's not surprising us once again.

234
00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:43.150
Not deviating off course.

235
00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:45.470
Not crying musical wolf.

236
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:50.302
So he reassures us with,
with what is arguably most over the top

237
00:15:50.302 --> 00:15:54.326
final cadence ever written
in the history of music.

238
00:15:54.326 --> 00:16:04.326
[MUSIC]

239
00:16:33.923 --> 00:16:39.080
[APPLAUSE] Well, again,
Beethoven the Great Communicator.

240
00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:42.630
We always know where we stand with
Beethoven, what his message is.

241
00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:46.550
And here the message is simple, the end,
the end, the end, the end, the end.

242
00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:52.490
Let's review what's special now about
Beethoven's Symphony Number Five.

243
00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:57.190
First of all,
it doesn't have a nickname oddly enough.

244
00:16:57.190 --> 00:17:01.050
We've got the Eroica as number three,
we've got the Pastoral as number six.

245
00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:05.515
We have this strange beginning [SOUND] as,
as I say here,

246
00:17:05.515 --> 00:17:11.606
something of a sucker punch, a surprise
punch in the nose at the beginning.

247
00:17:11.606 --> 00:17:15.420
There's the emphasis a constant
emphasis on the short,

248
00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:18.201
short, short long rhythmic motive, and

249
00:17:18.201 --> 00:17:24.660
almost all the material is derived from
that single motive or single musical cell.

250
00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:26.510
There's the importance
of the diminished chord,

251
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:31.355
that tension filled diminished chord,
particularly in the first movement.

252
00:17:31.355 --> 00:17:32.850
And there's the linking of the third and

253
00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:35.860
fourth movements by means
of a Beethovenian swell.

254
00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:36.890
That's the first time that had ever.

255
00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.550
Never been done in music.

256
00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:44.930
There is the bulking up of the orchestra
for the finale of this symphony and

257
00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:50.570
the emphasizing of sound for the sake
of sound, sound for the sake of sound.

258
00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:55.055
As we'll see here in our next session.
