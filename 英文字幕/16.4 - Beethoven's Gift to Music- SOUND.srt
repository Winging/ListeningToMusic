2
00:00:18.296 --> 00:00:19.880
Sorry to leave you hanging there.

3
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.337
Did that intentionally.

4
00:00:21.337 --> 00:00:26.830
The title of this segment is
Beethoven's Gift To Music: Sound.

5
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.820
That seems like a silly thing to say.

6
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.830
That Beethoven's gift to music was sound,
but in a sense it was.

7
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.736
He was the first composer to
create a sound that was so big,

8
00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:41.629
and so gorgeous that we, the listener,
well we just wanna wallow in it.

9
00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.484
By comparison, here's the sound of
a typical big symphony, by Haydn, and for

10
00:00:46.484 --> 00:00:48.379
Mozart too, for that matter.

11
00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:50.297
But here's one by Haydn.

12
00:00:50.297 --> 00:01:00.587
[MUSIC]

13
00:01:00.587 --> 00:01:03.296
End of Haydn's 94th Symphony.

14
00:01:03.296 --> 00:01:10.004
[MUSIC]

15
00:01:10.004 --> 00:01:12.295
Now that's a big sound for Haydn.

16
00:01:12.295 --> 00:01:14.379
That's as big as it gets.

17
00:01:14.379 --> 00:01:17.921
Now here's a moment in
a symphony by Beethoven.

18
00:01:17.921 --> 00:01:27.921
[MUSIC]

19
00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:48.465
Well obviously,
that's a huge buildup of volume.

20
00:01:48.465 --> 00:01:51.995
There's really only one musical
idea there that gets repeated over,

21
00:01:51.995 --> 00:01:53.795
and over, and over, and over again.

22
00:01:53.795 --> 00:01:57.220
Iteration, as more and
more instruments are added to play it and

23
00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.100
the volume of sound builds.

24
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.520
And almost inevitably with Beethoven,
as the volume sound builds to a climax,

25
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.060
the brasses enter with
an heroic sounding theme.

26
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.030
Here's another example of Beethoven
using the same sort of musical gambit

27
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.990
creating a grand gesture.

28
00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.010
As I like to call it.

29
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.181
This one is from the overture
to Leonore Number Three.

30
00:02:23.181 --> 00:02:27.560
And for this, we'll show an image drawn
from YouTube that's really a promo for

31
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.790
the London Philharmonic and
50 great classical hits.

32
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.420
But it's kind of fun to watch.

33
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:43.420
[MUSIC]

34
00:03:06.171 --> 00:03:09.379
And Beethoven not only wallowed in sound,
per se,

35
00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:12.655
just by itself,
merely to build a crescendo.

36
00:03:12.655 --> 00:03:16.215
Often, he seemed to do so, just because
he liked that particular sound.

37
00:03:16.215 --> 00:03:20.310
He was prepared to sit there for
a long time, because he liked the sound.

38
00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.560
This tended to make, of course,
his pieces much longer, and

39
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.549
here's a particularly lovely example
of that from his sixth symphony,

40
00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.921
the Pastoral Symphony, Symphony of 1808.

41
00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:35.629
And before we begin,
here's what he's doing, he's essentially.

42
00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:42.671
[MUSIC]

43
00:03:42.671 --> 00:03:47.211
It's really just coming down a triad
there, so let's give a listen.

44
00:03:47.211 --> 00:03:49.337
It's the autograph on the screen.

45
00:03:49.337 --> 00:03:54.586
[MUSIC]

46
00:03:54.586 --> 00:03:58.130
Om, there's the bottom note,

47
00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.212
your sitting on that note, om, om.

48
00:04:02.212 --> 00:04:04.837
[MUSIC]

49
00:04:04.837 --> 00:04:05.880
Finally is moving.

50
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:11.422
[MUSIC]

51
00:04:11.422 --> 00:04:15.445
Bass is playing,

52
00:04:15.445 --> 00:04:20.765
more and more volume.

53
00:04:20.765 --> 00:04:21.586
That was lovely.

54
00:04:21.586 --> 00:04:23.462
I really enjoyed that.

55
00:04:23.462 --> 00:04:28.921
By the way on the screen you can see the
autograph of this Pastoral symphony here.

56
00:04:28.921 --> 00:04:30.712
But he's not finished.

57
00:04:30.712 --> 00:04:35.837
[MUSIC]

58
00:04:35.837 --> 00:04:40.296
As a matter of fact, he's back,
he's starting again in another pitch.

59
00:04:40.296 --> 00:04:43.296
[MUSIC]

60
00:04:43.296 --> 00:04:44.836
All the way down there.

61
00:04:44.836 --> 00:04:48.171
It just sits on that, om.

62
00:04:48.171 --> 00:04:51.462
[MUSIC]

63
00:04:51.462 --> 00:04:55.421
Finally he moves, finally he moves

64
00:04:55.421 --> 00:05:05.421
[MUSIC]

65
00:05:15.586 --> 00:05:17.790
A long, long passage.

66
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:22.310
Just one sound, but
the sound is luxurious, it's gorgeous.

67
00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.710
Well how did he create this luxurious or
gorgeous sound?

68
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.230
Well he did it in part by
adding new instruments.

69
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:30.890
Let's go back to his 5th Symphony.

70
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.580
As you can see here In the 5th Symphony,
Beethoven adds for the first time,

71
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:37.970
the contrabassoon.

72
00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.950
Now the contrabassoon actually
plays the lowest pitches of any

73
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.790
instrument in a symphony orchestra.

74
00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:44.830
The lowest note.

75
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.530
Lower than the double bass.

76
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.180
So Beethoven is bulking up
the lower sounds of the orchestra.

77
00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.460
And in addition, he added trombones to
the symphony for this Symphony Number 5.

78
00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.080
Now that seems a strange thing to say,

79
00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.640
because trombones have really been
around since the 14th century.

80
00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.150
But they'd been used exclusively
in religious music and

81
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.210
in operas,
especially to signify the sounds of hell.

82
00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.920
But here Beethoven uses the trombone
in a symphony to enrich the sounds of

83
00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:19.230
the brasses, creating this big
robust brass, in the vernacular,

84
00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:25.780
ballsy sound, that became part and
partial of romantic music.

85
00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.355
Let's listen to a bit of the sound
of the trombone as heard here for

86
00:06:29.355 --> 00:06:33.125
the first time in a symphony here in
the final movement of the finale of

87
00:06:33.125 --> 00:06:35.212
Beethoven's Symphony Number five.

88
00:06:35.212 --> 00:06:39.587
We heard this before but let's focus
particularly on the brasses now.

89
00:06:39.587 --> 00:06:49.587
[MUSIC]

90
00:06:52.712 --> 00:06:55.250
The trombones are playing underneath.

91
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.905
And then they'll be foregrounded in just

92
00:06:59.905 --> 00:07:04.962
a second with part two of this first.

93
00:07:04.962 --> 00:07:09.504
[MUSIC]

94
00:07:09.504 --> 00:07:12.462
And here we go.

95
00:07:12.462 --> 00:07:14.879
Oops we're not gonna go,
but I'll play it for you.

96
00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:18.296
[MUSIC]

97
00:07:18.296 --> 00:07:20.128
Trombone solo.

98
00:07:20.128 --> 00:07:23.962
[MUSIC]

99
00:07:23.962 --> 00:07:26.505
And on it goes.

100
00:07:26.505 --> 00:07:30.796
But the addition of the contrabassoon and
trombone weren't all,

101
00:07:30.796 --> 00:07:34.931
Beethoven also here in the fifth
symphony adds a piccolo thereby

102
00:07:34.931 --> 00:07:37.700
expanding the top range of the orchestra.

103
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.260
Now Beethoven most
effectively used the piccolo,

104
00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:45.790
a smaller high flute of course, in
the storm scene of his pastoral symphony.

105
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:49.250
Here provides a sort of
sonic special effect

106
00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:54.640
of the wind whistling at the top of
the sonic spectrum during the storm.

107
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.670
This high piccolo can cut cleanly

108
00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:01.274
through even the densest
sort of orchestral texture.

109
00:08:01.274 --> 00:08:04.129
Let's give a listen.

110
00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:11.295
[MUSIC]

111
00:08:11.295 --> 00:08:12.296
Hear it up on top?

112
00:08:12.296 --> 00:08:22.296
[MUSIC]

113
00:08:23.796 --> 00:08:27.700
So Beethoven adds new instruments
to the orchestra, top and bottom.

114
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:32.440
And accordingly he creates
a larger orchestra, new woodwinds,

115
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.920
new brasses were added.

116
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:39.710
and to balance him, well, he needed more
strings, if Mozart had thirty, thirty five

117
00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:44.610
in his orchestra, Beethoven usually around
sixty players in his, twice the number.

118
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:51.845
And similarly, here we see Mozart's piano
on the left, and Beethoven's on the right.

119
00:08:51.845 --> 00:08:55.925
Mozart's piano weighed exactly,
still weighs that,

120
00:08:55.925 --> 00:08:59.945
because it still exists,
weights 187 pounds.

121
00:08:59.945 --> 00:09:03.895
Beethoven's Broadwood piano,
which also still exist,

122
00:09:03.895 --> 00:09:10.050
weighs about 400 pounds, more than twice
as much weight, twice as much volume.

123
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:15.070
So technology, in some ways, has allowed
Beethoven to create this bigger sound,

124
00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:18.770
and to delight in it, to stop the music.

125
00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:23.860
I don't need more motifs,
don't need more themes, more melodies.

126
00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:24.950
I just wanna hear that sound.

127
00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:25.780
I wanna hear that sound.

128
00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.320
Do you hear that, do you hear that,
do you hear that?

129
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.530
That's what he seems to be saying in so
much of his music.

130
00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:32.780
Beethoven could make the sound bigger,

131
00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:36.660
hit the ball farther,
because he had new and better equipment.

132
00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:41.180
A silly comparison I know,
but it makes a point.

133
00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.120
Well, let's see what we've
learned in this segment.

134
00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.440
Let's review, by means of a quiz.

135
00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.310
I'll let you study for a few moments.

136
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.336
And then we'll talk about the answer.

137
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.230
Okay, let's see how you did, now.

138
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:12.119
Let's check out the incorrect answer.

139
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.280
Okay, good for you.

140
00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.550
C is correct.

141
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:22.760
Beethoven actually slows down
the rate at which musical ideas,

142
00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.550
new motives, melodies,
harmonies, etcetera,

143
00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:29.140
slows down the rate at which
musical ideas come to us.

144
00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:35.070
Because he wanted to take more time to
stop and enjoy the sound of the moment.

145
00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:40.175
For him more than any previous composer,
the sound was the theme.
