[MUSIC]

2
00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:13.350
Remember this image?

3
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.570
It was created by
an artist in 1938 to give

4
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.830
a sense of what Beethoven's life was like
as he reached middle age and beyond.

5
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.850
Although fictitious,
it does contain many elements of truth.

6
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.830
The mess all around,
the broken piano strings,

7
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.730
the bowl of porridge on the keyboard.

8
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.640
And especially the ear trumpet,
lower left, that helped Beethoven hear.

9
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.760
Let's visit the bear in his lair.

10
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.800
Here's a 19th century map of Vienna.

11
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.590
We've actually seen it before.

12
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.080
Although Beethoven moved a lot,
and sometimes had two or

13
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.860
three abodes simultaneously,
in his late middle age, his most used

14
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.470
apartment was on the ramparts of Vienna,
on the walls protecting the old city.

15
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.360
Remember Napoleon's bombing there in 1809.

16
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.180
And here's how the same building looks
today, still up on the ramparts.

17
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.150
Called the Pasqualati House.

18
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.020
Let's go inside.

19
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.520
Here we see a piano from Beethoven's day,

20
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.660
though not one that
Beethoven himself played.

21
00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.290
We'll see one of these later.

22
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.390
What was life like here
in Beethoven's apartment?

23
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.330
Well, a contemporary observer visiting
from Paris about 1809 tells us

24
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.360
what he saw.

25
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.640
Quote, imagine all that is most filthy and
untidy, puddles on the floor,

26
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.960
a rather old grand piano covered in
dust and laden with piles of music.

27
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.680
Beneath it, I do not exaggerate,
an unemptied chamberpot.

28
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.800
The little walnut desk
next to the piano was

29
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.010
evidently accustomed to having the
contents of the inkwell spilled over it.

30
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.300
The chairs were covered with plates full
of the remains of the previous evening's

31
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.990
meal and with clothes.

32
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.950
Now, the person who saw Beethoven the most
in his last years was a lad of 12.

33
00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.335
The son of an old family friend of
Beethoven, one Gerhard von Breuning,

34
00:02:00.335 --> 00:02:06.390
who tagged along after the aging composer,
and later wrote down what he saw.

35
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.530
Here's one story the young Breuning tells
about Beethoven, now completely deaf,

36
00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.580
as the composer enters a cafe.

37
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.660
Here's a cafe like the Frauenhuber Cafe
that we saw earlier.

38
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.580
So, Beethoven comes in and he sits down.

39
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.230
And this is where his music was performed,
this is where he often had dinner.

40
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.130
He comes in, and he sits down.

41
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.087
Let me read you a quote
here from Von Bruening.

42
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.305
He knocked for the waiter.

43
00:02:33.305 --> 00:02:36.017
[SOUND] Who did not come at once.

44
00:02:36.017 --> 00:02:37.195
Then he knocked again.

45
00:02:37.195 --> 00:02:41.195
[SOUND] And while waiting, he took out his
music notebook and started to compose.

46
00:02:41.195 --> 00:02:46.020
Finally the waiter appeared but the deaf
master was no longer aware of him.

47
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.310
Since Beethoven was a steady customer, the
waiter went away, and Beethoven wrote for

48
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.770
a long time, deep in thought.

49
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.740
Finally, he closed his book and
asked for the bill to pay for his meal,

50
00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.150
but he had neither received nor
eaten anything.

51
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.090
This is what Von Breuning had to
say regarding Beethoven's demeanor.

52
00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.460
He was neither handsome nor elegant,
in fact, he was unkempt and

53
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:19.910
even wild in his appearance as you
can see from this direct quote.

54
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.320
And his behavior was sometimes,
well, downright bizarre,

55
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.110
as we can see from this next
quote that I'll read here.

56
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.420
"He always had the habit, when he had been
at his desk for a long time composing,

57
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.240
then he felt that his head was overheated,
of rushing over to the washstand and

58
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.710
pouring jugs of water over his
head." All of this was done in

59
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.330
the greatest haste in order not
to lose the flow of his ideas.

60
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:45.670
That's interesting.

61
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.270
Without his noticing it the water he
poured over his head would sometimes go

62
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.070
all over the floor and even through
the ceiling to the floor below and

63
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:57.345
this occasionally led to disagreeable
situations with the people downstairs.

64
00:03:57.345 --> 00:04:00.040
[LAUGH] I bet they did.

65
00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.520
Another quote,
another characteristic of his

66
00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.210
was the vehemence with which he would
discuss subjects that interested him.

67
00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.030
And sometimes, as he walked up and
down the room during such discussions,

68
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.616
he would spit on the mirror,
instead of out the window,

69
00:04:15.616 --> 00:04:21.180
without noticing the difference.

70
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.330
Well, by the 1820s,
Beethoven had changed apartments yet

71
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.190
again, now to the house
of the Black Spaniards.

72
00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.690
And you can see that here on
the map with the blue star.

73
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.910
The building once existed, but
was torn down around 1900.

74
00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.730
But there's an early photograph of it,

75
00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.788
with my arrow pointing to the windows
that were Beethoven's windows.

76
00:04:42.788 --> 00:04:45.310
Young Von Bruening's detailed

77
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.590
description of this apartment
allows us to reconstruct it.

78
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.680
And as you can see,
I'll use a little pointer here.

79
00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.770
So, we come into, up the stairs.

80
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.140
He always lived in these
top floor apartments.

81
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.945
Comes into an ante-chamber,
took off his coat.

82
00:05:01.945 --> 00:05:05.580
Come into this entrance hall here
that was filled with portraits

83
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.170
of some relatives and
other people of interest to him.

84
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.960
This was his music room over here where
he kept essentially the scores of music,

85
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.570
existing scores of music.

86
00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.290
But his principal music
room was over here.

87
00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.600
Here he had two pianos, and

88
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.320
we're going to take a look at
one of those two pianos now.

89
00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.180
Here's an engraving made only
a few days after his death.

90
00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.330
Through the window we you
can see the moonlight and

91
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.980
the spire, the Saint Steven's Cathedral
in the background.

92
00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:35.910
And now look.

93
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.340
This is very interesting.

94
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.070
Look how somebody has tidied up the floor.

95
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.840
Beethoven's music is all now
neatly stacked down below.

96
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.810
Actually, there were two
grand pianos in this room.

97
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.990
A Graft that we don't see here on the
right, and an English Broadwood given to

98
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:58.630
him in 1817 on the left, that we do see.

99
00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.440
Okay, so this was the essential music
room and it had the pianos in it.

100
00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.860
Let's go back to our floor plan now.

101
00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.780
Now, remember that Bruening said that
Beethoven didn't actually write music

102
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:09.330
at the piano.

103
00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:10.280
Why would he want to?

104
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.180
He was deaf anyway.

105
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.580
He couldn't hear.

106
00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.160
But he composed instead
at a small walnut desk,

107
00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.860
which by this time he kept in
a separate room over here.

108
00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.940
And that desk also survives today.

109
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.480
It's in the Beethoven House in Bonn.

110
00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.250
Isn't that interesting?

111
00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:28.850
But let's go back to our floor plan.

112
00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:34.360
And here we see not only the pianos and
these two windows, but

113
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:39.440
Beethoven had his bed in
this essential music room.

114
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.640
And it was here that he died in 1827.

115
00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:48.530
Now here's and engraving of the death
mask of Beethoven by a well-respected

116
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:54.770
Viennese artist, Josef Dannhauser, done
only a day or two after Beethoven's death.

117
00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.710
And now another contemporary
engraving showing

118
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:04.535
Beethoven's body being carried out of his
apartment that's the arrow on the right,

119
00:07:04.535 --> 00:07:08.790
with his corpse and
the pallbearers the arrows on the left.

120
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:14.830
It was taken to a local church that church
still exists, here we see it on the left,

121
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:20.350
for the funeral and then sometimes later
it was carried and ultimately interred

122
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:25.760
in the Zentralfriedhof outside
of Vienna where it rests today.

123
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.010
Nearby are Schubert and Brahms by the way.

124
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:33.520
But let's look again at this
image of Beethoven's funeral.

125
00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.468
Look at the crowd.

126
00:07:34.468 --> 00:07:36.680
More than 20,000 people,

127
00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:41.190
one in every ten citizens in Vienna
turned out for this funeral.

128
00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:46.020
That's far more per capita than turned
out for the funeral of Michael Jackson.

129
00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:50.530
Schools were closed and
the army was called out to maintain order.

130
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:52.972
Beethoven had become a rock star.
