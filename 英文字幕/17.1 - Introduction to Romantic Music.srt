[MUSIC]

2
00:00:10.254 --> 00:00:12.129
Romance, romantic.

3
00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:14.128
What does that term, romance mean?

4
00:00:14.128 --> 00:00:16.847
Well we have romance languages,

5
00:00:16.847 --> 00:00:22.004
meaning those that derive from Latin,
French, and Italian.

6
00:00:22.004 --> 00:00:24.755
We have romance, meaning love and
love relationships.

7
00:00:24.755 --> 00:00:30.545
A romantic, well,
someone who is eternally idealistic.

8
00:00:30.545 --> 00:00:33.065
Now, these last two senses,
Love and Idealism,

9
00:00:33.065 --> 00:00:37.212
are associated with sentiments important
in the west during the 19th century.

10
00:00:37.212 --> 00:00:40.212
So we call this the Romantic Era.

11
00:00:40.212 --> 00:00:44.921
Here we see the dates of
the Romantic Period, roughly 1820 to 1900.

12
00:00:44.921 --> 00:00:49.629
But all of this is very fluid and these
periods overlap, as we've said before.

13
00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:55.180
But why look at this dreary slide when
we have images like this to look at.

14
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.320
Here is Eugen Delacroix's Romeo and
Juliet.

15
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.240
This was the century in which their
romance and those of others, Paolo and

16
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.550
Francesca de Rimini and Tristan and
Isolde, for example, were revivified.

17
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.480
So, idealistic love.

18
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.810
Romance and Romantic Narratives are at
the center of the Romantic Sensibility.

19
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.460
Another almost obsession
with romantics was Nature.

20
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.360
Here we see a slide of John Martin's
MacBeth on the Heaths, a vast landscape.

21
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.180
Nature too worked her magic on
the minds of the romantics.

22
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.880
Wild, untamed, all powerful nature.

23
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.200
We see this in the art and
we hear it in the music.

24
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.010
Beirden's Pastoral Symphony,

25
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.780
Schubert's The Trout Quintet,
Strauss's Alpine Symphony, are typical.

26
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.047
Here's an example by Johannes Brahms
written at the end of the 19th century.

27
00:01:52.047 --> 00:01:53.987
It's a song with German lyrics, and

28
00:01:53.987 --> 00:01:58.254
as you'll see from the English translation
it's full of references to nature.

29
00:01:58.254 --> 00:02:03.546
Dark night, mild wind, flowers the moon,
the stars the birdsong and so on.

30
00:02:03.546 --> 00:02:04.046
[MUSIC]

31
00:02:04.046 --> 00:02:14.046
Sometimes,

32
00:02:22.816 --> 00:02:29.640
as in

33
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.759
the

34
00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:44.954
song,

35
00:02:44.954 --> 00:02:54.954
human's

36
00:02:58.605 --> 00:03:03.724
and

37
00:03:03.724 --> 00:03:13.962
nature

38
00:03:13.962 --> 00:03:22.493
are in

39
00:03:22.493 --> 00:03:32.493
harmony.

40
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.270
Often a human soul contemplates
the wonders of nature.

41
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.940
As in this image, by one of my favorite
painter's of the romantic era.

42
00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.250
The German, Caspar David Friedrich.

43
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.450
This painting is called,
appropriately enough, The Dreamer.

44
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.950
But here notice the church,
a man made construction,

45
00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.950
how it bonds as one with
the trees in the background.

46
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.181
There's no barrier between the human and

47
00:04:05.181 --> 00:04:09.713
the natural world here in
the imagination of The Dreamer.

48
00:04:09.713 --> 00:04:14.634
Dreaming too was part of the aesthetic or
Romantic music.

49
00:04:14.634 --> 00:04:19.806
With this image of The Dreamer on the
screen, let me play as a bit of background

50
00:04:19.806 --> 00:04:24.833
music a portion of Robert Schumann's
piano piece, Traumerei Dreaming.

51
00:04:24.833 --> 00:04:28.546
Composed as you see in 1838.

52
00:04:28.546 --> 00:04:38.546
[MUSIC]

53
00:04:47.048 --> 00:04:52.345
But the Romantic period was also an age
in which dreams could go tragically array

54
00:04:52.345 --> 00:04:57.422
with depictions of nightmares of
the fantastic and the phantasmagorical.

55
00:04:57.422 --> 00:05:03.956
Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre Dame
and Mary Shelly's Frankenstein and

56
00:05:03.956 --> 00:05:11.086
Francisco Goya's Saturn eating his young,
from the Prado in Madrid, as shown here.

57
00:05:11.086 --> 00:05:17.193
In music the horrific is audible in pieces
such as Mendelssohn's Varporgisnaught and

58
00:05:17.193 --> 00:05:19.962
Musorgsky's Night on Bald Mountain.

59
00:05:19.962 --> 00:05:29.962
[MUSIC]

60
00:05:54.046 --> 00:05:56.980
Well, that's enough of that for
the moment, let's fade that out.

61
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.120
The 19th century is also the age
of poetry and the romantic poets.

62
00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.580
Victor Hugo and friends, Goethe, Heine,
Eichendorff in Germany and of course,

63
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:13.200
the English Romantics of Wordsworth,
Keats, Shelley, and Lord George Byron.

64
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.840
Here's a slide of Byron.

65
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.590
He traveled over the Alps,
swam the Hellespont, fought and died for

66
00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.810
Greek independence, and seems to have
had an affair with his half-sister.

67
00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.560
That bad, and dangerous to know,
was the saying of the day, about Byron.

68
00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.700
Mad, bad, and dangerous to know.

69
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:36.100
Well, many romantic artists seemed
to have been such, as well.

70
00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:41.650
But Byron was also a gifted poet,
who inspired many musicians.

71
00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:45.890
Here's a 19th century printed
volume of Byron's poetry.

72
00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:47.090
Who bought these books?

73
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:52.330
This flood of romantic poetry that
appeared on the scene in the early 1800s.

74
00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:57.837
Well, buyers from the increasingly
large middle class.
