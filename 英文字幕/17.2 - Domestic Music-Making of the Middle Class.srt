[MUSIC]

2
00:00:10.514 --> 00:00:14.509
When I was a student taking
history courses, I was puzzled.

3
00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:16.060
Almost every period that I studied
discussed the rise of the middle class.

4
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.470
And I suppose that's true,
in every age, after the middle ages.

5
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.310
In the middle ages there
was only one class.

6
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.490
High clergy on one side and
the aristocracy.

7
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.630
Well, they were the 1% and everybody else,
well, they were on the on side.

8
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.520
The peasants were on the other side.

9
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.850
There after Little by little the middle
class seems to have been on a constant

10
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.260
rise down to the present day.

11
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.070
And this was particularly
true in the 19th century.

12
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.950
In the United States, the number of
people in the urban middle class

13
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.450
went from roughly 5 to 35% of
the population during the 19th century.

14
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.320
In Britain,
incomes doubled between 1850 and 1906.

15
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.230
So too, a similar growth in
the numbers of homes that had

16
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.780
pianos at the center of what we, in the
United States, would call a living room.

17
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.860
But they, in those days, called a talking
room or parlor, really a gathering center.

18
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.660
And at the epicenter of the parlor was
the piano, around which the family

19
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.480
gathered before the days of TV and
computers, for fun and for relaxation.

20
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.660
This was the center of a new and
important kind of music making.

21
00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:37.309
Private, domestic music making, but still
music making with aspirations to high art.

22
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.310
Here again, is the entertainment
center in Beethoven's day,

23
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.620
The Public Theater Opera House,
where Beethoven's Symphony No.

24
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.550
5 has premiered in 1808.

25
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.182
But now,
here's another kind of music center.

26
00:01:52.182 --> 00:01:56.048
One that developed 15 or 20 years later.

27
00:01:56.048 --> 00:02:01.420
We're now in the home of Middle class or
Upper middle class family.

28
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.000
This in fact, is the home of
one Joseph von Spaum in Vienna.

29
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.230
He was a friend and
patron of the composer Franz Schubert.

30
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:13.920
Senior Michael Vogl is at the center,
there at the left arrow,

31
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.670
and composer Franz Schubert
accompanies him, seated at the piano.

32
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.540
In early 19th century Vienna,
they called such gatherings Schubertiades,

33
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.210
because only the music of
Schubert was performed.

34
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.440
A Schubertiade then,
was a domestic gathering, a party,

35
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.569
that featured the songs and
dances of Franz Schubert.

36
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.390
And look closely,
the ladies still look splendid,

37
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.160
the gentleman are still wearing neck ties,
but everyone is now looking inward.

38
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.890
This is not art for external large
scale public consumption, but private,

39
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.310
domestic music making in an upper middle
class home, as the furnishing suggests.

40
00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.100
Now, here's that same scene,
I emphasize again,

41
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.590
the same scene reillustrated
some 30 years later.

42
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.380
Art, as is true with history,
can be manipulated to tell more or

43
00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.220
less any story the creator or
the historian wants.

44
00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.780
Schubert's reputation has grown greatly
since his death [LAUGH] in 1828.

45
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.330
And so has Schubert.

46
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.380
He's now much larger in this painting.

47
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.160
And where's the singer Michael Vogel?

48
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.850
Well, he was originally there, but
now he's disappeared entirely.

49
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.070
Leaving Schubert the center of attention.

50
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.530
Revisionist history, so
let's focus on Franz Schubert, and

51
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.305
find out more about him.
