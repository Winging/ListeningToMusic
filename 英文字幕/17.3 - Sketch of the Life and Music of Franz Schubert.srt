00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:09.886
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:09.886 --> 00:00:13.021
Franz Schubert was born in Vienna in 1797.

3
00:00:13.021 --> 00:00:13.907
He was the son of a school
principal who encouraged

4
00:00:13.907 --> 00:00:14.570
the boy's obvious musical talent.

5
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.820
When he was 11,
young Schubert competed for, and

6
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.260
won, a place as a boy soprano in
the famous Imperial Court Chapel.

7
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.810
The boys of which,
their descendants at least,

8
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.283
are still known today as
the Vienna Boys Choir.

9
00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:40.283
At the age of 15, Schubert's voice broke,
as he said, he croaked his last.

10
00:00:40.283 --> 00:00:44.384
And so he was gradually eased out of
the choir, and out of the choir school,

11
00:00:44.384 --> 00:00:48.444
and when on to earn an effective
teaching certificate at a local college.

12
00:00:48.444 --> 00:00:54.167
So he tried his hand at grade school
teaching in his father's school,

13
00:00:54.167 --> 00:00:56.884
but with no particular success.

14
00:00:56.884 --> 00:01:02.866
So Schubert quit his day job, and although
he gave music lessons from time to time,

15
00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:08.078
and had some small income from
publishing his songs, for the most part,

16
00:01:08.078 --> 00:01:12.200
Schubert live a Bohemian existence,
no steady income.

17
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.796
Roaming with friends and

18
00:01:13.796 --> 00:01:17.596
mentors in downtown Vienna as
the situation required, and

19
00:01:17.596 --> 00:01:22.700
spending much of his evening pub crawling,
as he called it, with his friends.

20
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.780
But composer Schubert was
remarkably productive,

21
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.510
producing nearly a thousand
compositions and

22
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.139
more than 600 songs in his short life
of just 31 years, yes, 31 years.

23
00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:38.799
Here's Schubert in his youth,
wearing his iconic glasses.

24
00:01:40.732 --> 00:01:45.340
And here's Schubert in his late 20s,
one of the last portraits of him.

25
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.680
Mozart, Hayden, Beethoven and Schubert,
well they were all 5 feet 5 inches tall or

26
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.040
less, and
Schubert was the shortest of them all.

27
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.940
His diminutive size and glasses
exempted him from military services,

28
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.350
a boon to music history.

29
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.400
Anyway, although Schubert wrote in all
genres of music, operas, religious music,

30
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.220
chamber music, piano sonatas, and
symphonies, he's known today firstly,

31
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.490
as a composer of art songs,
as we said, more than 600 of them.

32
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.660
Indeed, Schubert created the art
song of classical music,

33
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.210
the art song as we know it
in classical music today.

34
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.940
The Germans call the 19th century
art song, and we often do as well,

35
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:38.230
we English speakers do as well, they
called it a Lied, Lieder in the plural.

36
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.490
The high art song with piano
accompaniment of the 19th century.

37
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.840
To the extent that Schubert was known at
all in Vienna, and he didn't really become

38
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.520
famous until after his death,
he was known as the composer of Lieder.

39
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.210
But let's back up to
Schubert's early years.

40
00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.360
Indeed, he was a prodigy as a composer,
like Mozart before him.

41
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.350
Here's a song Schubert wrote in 1816,
when he was 19.

42
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:10.500
It's about a fish, a trout, again,
more nature in the romantic era.

43
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.642
The visuals of this video
are a little bit silly, but

44
00:03:13.642 --> 00:03:16.642
we get a good English
translation of the German and

45
00:03:16.642 --> 00:03:21.656
the singer here is the incomparable Leider
specialist Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau

46
00:03:21.656 --> 00:03:31.656
[MUSIC]

47
00:03:33.586 --> 00:03:35.629
Phrase one, part one.

[MUSIC]

49
00:03:39.623 --> 00:03:40.446
Part two.

51
00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:44.905
Phrase two, part one.

53
00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:48.967

55
00:03:52.962 --> 00:03:55.226
Phrase two, part two repeated.

00:03:55.226 --> 00:03:57.419
[MUSIC]

57
00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:59.697
Now because this is a strophic song,

58
00:03:59.697 --> 00:04:03.084
the music is gonna start all
over again with a new text.

59
00:04:03.084 --> 00:04:05.499
Phrase one, part one

60
00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:09.086
[MUSIC]

61
00:04:09.086 --> 00:04:13.196

00:04:13.196 --> 00:04:14.763
[MUSIC]

63
00:04:14.763 --> 00:04:16.017
Phrase two, part one.

64
00:04:16.017 --> 00:04:20.916
[MUSIC]

65
00:04:20.916 --> 00:04:22.065
Phrase two, part two.

66
00:04:22.065 --> 00:04:26.244
[MUSIC]

67
00:04:26.244 --> 00:04:29.924
And phrase two part two, repeated.

68
00:04:29.924 --> 00:04:34.311
And that's probably enough of that,

69
00:04:34.311 --> 00:04:38.980
he faded out right about here, lovely.

70
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.183
What we're paying attention
to in particular here,

71
00:04:42.183 --> 00:04:46.038
is the ingratiating melody, and
the bubbling accompaniment.

72
00:04:46.038 --> 00:04:50.577
It's typical of the freshness and
sweetness of the Schubert sound.

73
00:04:50.577 --> 00:04:55.035
Now Schubert knew a good thing when he
heard it, or at least when he created it.

74
00:04:55.035 --> 00:05:00.596
And as it heightened before him,
Schubert took an excellent song tune and

75
00:05:00.596 --> 00:05:04.194
made it even greater,
made even more out of it.

76
00:05:04.194 --> 00:05:07.549
He used it again as
a piece of chamber music,

77
00:05:07.549 --> 00:05:12.913
specifically here in a quintet for
piano and strings a few year later.

78
00:05:12.913 --> 00:05:16.133
So again,
he's taking this preexisting song, and

79
00:05:16.133 --> 00:05:20.319
he's gonna use it as a movement in
a quintet for a piano and strings.

80
00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:24.515
As you watch this video from
a group of Korea, first a question,

81
00:05:24.515 --> 00:05:27.714
which instrument is
playing Schubert's song?

82
00:05:32.869 --> 00:05:43.109
[MUSIC]

83
00:05:43.109 --> 00:05:44.652
Tempo's a little bit slower.

84
00:05:44.652 --> 00:05:48.831
[MUSIC]

85
00:05:48.831 --> 00:05:54.176
And notice now in the chamber version,
Schubert repeats

86
00:05:54.176 --> 00:05:59.534
the phrases of the melody,
this is phrase one repeated.

87
00:05:59.534 --> 00:06:02.054
[MUSIC]

88
00:06:02.054 --> 00:06:03.331
And of course the question was,
who's playing the melody?

89
00:06:03.331 --> 00:06:08.231
Well the first violinist
is playing the melody.

90
00:06:08.231 --> 00:06:09.774
Now we're going on to phrase two.

91
00:06:09.774 --> 00:06:19.774
[MUSIC]

92
00:06:21.034 --> 00:06:22.613
That's the viola.

93
00:06:22.613 --> 00:06:24.645
[MUSIC]

94
00:06:24.645 --> 00:06:28.650
And back to the first violin,
this is the end of our second phrase.

95
00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:33.166
[MUSIC]

96
00:06:33.166 --> 00:06:35.533
Now the piano will jump in,
with the melody ornamented.

97
00:06:35.533 --> 00:06:45.533
[MUSIC]

98
00:06:51.472 --> 00:06:57.188
Repeat, the other strings
are just adding counterpoint,

99
00:06:57.188 --> 00:07:00.969
fast counterpoint against the piano.

100
00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:04.731
[MUSIC]

101
00:07:04.731 --> 00:07:05.706
The second phrase.

102
00:07:05.706 --> 00:07:07.690
[MUSIC]

103
00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.349
There's our violist
providing counterpoint.

104
00:07:10.349 --> 00:07:14.482
Here's the unusual distribution.

105
00:07:14.482 --> 00:07:18.531
We don't really have
a string quartet here, but

106
00:07:18.531 --> 00:07:23.480
a quartet first violin, viola,
cello, and double bass.

107
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:28.389
There's no second violin, the double
bass replaces the second violin here.

108
00:07:28.389 --> 00:07:30.119
Who's got the melody now?

109
00:07:30.119 --> 00:07:35.844
[MUSIC]

110
00:07:35.844 --> 00:07:41.287
Well not the first violin, he's playing
counterpoint, mostly scalar fashion.

111
00:07:41.287 --> 00:07:51.287
[MUSIC]

112
00:07:55.705 --> 00:07:58.364
There it is to the right,
the viola has the melody.

113
00:07:58.364 --> 00:08:03.043
[MUSIC]

114
00:08:03.043 --> 00:08:06.177
Here's our second phrase, viola.

115
00:08:06.177 --> 00:08:10.403
[MUSIC]

116
00:08:10.403 --> 00:08:16.381
The piano is just answering,
responding to the cello.

117
00:08:16.381 --> 00:08:24.218
[MUSIC]

118
00:08:24.218 --> 00:08:25.842
Next, a variation.

119
00:08:25.842 --> 00:08:27.921
[MUSIC]

120
00:08:27.921 --> 00:08:33.238
Double bass now has the melody,
as you can see.

121
00:08:33.238 --> 00:08:34.178
[MUSIC]

122
00:08:34.178 --> 00:08:36.438
Okay, let's phase it out here,

123
00:08:36.438 --> 00:08:41.687
with a sense of the wonderful quality of
what is arguably one of the funniest,

124
00:08:41.687 --> 00:08:46.716
and most ingratiating pieces in
the entire repertoire of chamber music.

125
00:08:46.716 --> 00:08:51.696
This music built on
a song by Franz Schubert.

126
00:08:51.696 --> 00:08:54.837
And this gives you a sense of
the seemingly effortless ease,

127
00:08:54.837 --> 00:08:57.616
with which Schubert could
write this sort of melody.

128
00:08:57.616 --> 00:09:03.395
Shubert's like Mozart in this regard,
seemingly effortless lyricism,

129
00:09:03.395 --> 00:09:09.551
as we heard here, in the case of our scaly
friends Trout, in the Trout quintet.

130
00:09:09.551 --> 00:09:16.139
But let's back up further to a Lied that
Schubert wrote a year earlier, in 1815,

131
00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:21.460
Erlkonig, or Erlking, then as now,
Schubert's best known work.
