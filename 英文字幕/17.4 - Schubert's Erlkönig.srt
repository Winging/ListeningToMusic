00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:11.774 --> 00:00:16.650
Here we see Schubert's first
published work, the Art Song or

3
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.663
Lied Erlkonig, Elf King in english.

4
00:00:19.663 --> 00:00:21.759
This wasn't Schubert's
earliest composition.

5
00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:25.239
But it was the first one he
was able to get published,

6
00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:28.258
as it says here on the title page,
1st Werk.

7
00:00:28.258 --> 00:00:30.942
And it became a smash hit.

8
00:00:30.942 --> 00:00:33.259
In the course of the 19th century,

9
00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:37.010
nearly 100 composers did arrangements or
covers of it.

10
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.340
Indeed this one song alone made Schubert's
reputation in the 19th century.

11
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.990
How old was he when he wrote this
masterpiece, this song for eternity?

12
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.800
The ripe old age of 18,
which causes me to ask,

13
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.940
who wrote the greatest piece,
a masterpiece, at the earliest age?

14
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.090
Mendelson, with his octet,
Mozart, Schubert?

15
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.560
Paul McCartney,
with Love Love Love Me Do, he was 15.

16
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.164
Well it's difficult to say, but
one could make a strong case for

17
00:01:08.164 --> 00:01:10.047
Schubert and his Lied Erlkonig.

18
00:01:10.047 --> 00:01:11.290
What's this song about?

19
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.450
Well to know what any song's about,
you just have to look at the lyrics.

20
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.520
Unlike purely instrumental music, in
which the music itself does the talking,

21
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.450
here with a song
the lyrics tell the story.

22
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.140
What's interesting is that,
unlike the Beatles say,

23
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.090
who generally wrote their own music and
the lyrics, in the Romantic era,

24
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.990
none of the great composers was
a great poet of song lyrics.

25
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.510
Each went to a work of a poet,
opened up this book of poetry, and

26
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.830
found a suitable poem and set it to music.

27
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.925
So let's look at the poem Erlkonig.

28
00:01:51.925 --> 00:01:55.040
Schubert found the poem in
the works of the famous poet

29
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.070
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.

30
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.860
Here we see the 18 year old Schubert's
original score set in Goethe's poetry.

31
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.920
And we can follow,
let's see if my cursor is working here.

32
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.070
There we go.

33
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.174
And here is the beginning of the text.

34
00:02:13.174 --> 00:02:18.231
[FOREIGN]
And

35
00:02:18.231 --> 00:02:24.300
so on it goes.

36
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.163
Now there were two kinds of poetry, or

37
00:02:26.163 --> 00:02:30.650
two principal kinds of poetry in
the 19th century, lyric and narrative.

38
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.090
Lyric poetry was usually about love or
nature, and

39
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.160
was usually set in strophic form.

40
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.500
Narrative poetry, on the other hand, tells
a story, usually a well-known story, or

41
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.690
a legend in the form of
what is called a ballad.

42
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.356
A ballad is a long, sad story or
legend set as poetry.

43
00:02:49.356 --> 00:02:54.730
Now, the Erlkonig is an old
Nordic folk story or legend

44
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.960
about the king of elves who, if he laid
on his hands on the child brought evil,

45
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.770
indeed, killed the child
simply by his touch.

46
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.000
So don't expect a happy ending
here from the Erlkonig in

47
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.519
our poetic ballad by Goethe, no sir.

48
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:11.854
Here's the text.

49
00:03:11.854 --> 00:03:15.538
Let me try reading it to you in my not so
good German, and

50
00:03:15.538 --> 00:03:18.305
you try following along, the English.

51
00:03:18.305 --> 00:03:20.937
It's important, very important here,

52
00:03:20.937 --> 00:03:24.331
that we understand the text
of this particular Lied.

53
00:03:24.331 --> 00:03:31.986
[FOREIGN]

54
00:03:31.986 --> 00:03:37.453
And as

55
00:03:37.453 --> 00:03:45.107
you will

56
00:03:45.107 --> 00:03:51.668
hear,

57
00:03:51.668 --> 00:04:00.417
Schubert

58
00:04:00.417 --> 00:04:06.978
treats

59
00:04:06.978 --> 00:04:16.820
Goethe's

60
00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:23.381
ballad

61
00:04:23.381 --> 00:04:32.130
Erlkonig

62
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.317
as

63
00:04:34.317 --> 00:04:43.065
a through

64
00:04:43.065 --> 00:04:51.814
composed

65
00:04:51.814 --> 00:05:00.562
Lied, no

66
00:05:00.562 --> 00:05:11.498
repetition

67
00:05:11.498 --> 00:05:16.965
in the

68
00:05:16.965 --> 00:05:24.630
music.

69
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.230
Again, it unfolds continuously
from beginning to end.

70
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:34.920
Okay, the Schubert Erlkonig challenge,
how does Schubert

71
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:40.380
use a host of musical gestures, musical
symbols, to paint this frightful scene?

72
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.450
And indeed many artists did paint and
continue to paint

73
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.930
right down to the present day
the frightful scene of the Erlkonig.

74
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.390
Here you see that of Moritz Schwind
a good friend of Schubert who knew

75
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:52.760
what Schubert had in mind.

76
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:59.830
So back to our challenge,
your task is to identify at least

77
00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:06.820
five musical gestures used to characterize
the actors and the events in this drama.

78
00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.955
How does he depict, for example,
the galloping horse, the steady father,

79
00:06:10.955 --> 00:06:13.442
the excitable son, and
his growing anxiety?

80
00:06:13.442 --> 00:06:19.418
The Erlkonig in his charming ways and the
Erlkonig with his deadly trick, the horse,

81
00:06:19.418 --> 00:06:24.910
slowing down, and the tragic end,
how did Schubert depict all this in music?

82
00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:32.020
Well, we're going to follow along with
a score that integrates a recording and

83
00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.200
some other information about the structure
of Schubert's harmonic language,

84
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.890
a score, a video here,
prepared by my colleague, David Thomas.

85
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.720
As we go along, I'll identify for
your who is speaking.

86
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:50.159
And you think about what the musical
gesture is that Schubert employs

87
00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:57.017
to underscore, to heighten though music
the dramatic story that's about to unfold.

88
00:06:57.017 --> 00:07:07.017
[MUSIC]

89
00:07:15.842 --> 00:07:17.697
Okay, narrator begins.

90
00:07:17.697 --> 00:07:21.445

91
00:07:21.445 --> 00:07:25.441

[MUSIC]

93
00:07:46.792 --> 00:07:48.821

95
00:07:52.315 --> 00:07:58.451
Whoops, that's the father's song.

96
00:07:58.451 --> 00:07:59.894

98
00:08:10.313 --> 00:08:13.937
Now the father replies.

100
00:08:20.954 --> 00:08:25.981

102
00:08:31.088 --> 00:08:32.768
And the accompaniment changes.

103
00:08:32.768 --> 00:08:42.768
[MUSIC]

104
00:08:45.771 --> 00:08:47.011
The boy.

105
00:08:47.011 --> 00:08:49.920
[MUSIC]

106
00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.755
What's happening to his pitch level?

107
00:08:52.755 --> 00:08:57.876
[MUSIC]

108
00:08:57.876 --> 00:08:59.913
And now where do we go for the father?

109
00:08:59.913 --> 00:09:00.732
[MUSIC]

110
00:09:00.732 --> 00:09:03.041
[INAUDIBLE] of rain.

111
00:09:03.041 --> 00:09:07.658
[MUSIC]

112
00:09:07.658 --> 00:09:09.206
Back to the Erlking, again.

113
00:09:09.206 --> 00:09:12.332
How does the music change here?

114
00:09:12.332 --> 00:09:22.332
[MUSIC]

115
00:09:26.254 --> 00:09:31.209
The boy, has his music changed yet again?

116
00:09:31.209 --> 00:09:38.535
[MUSIC]

117
00:09:38.535 --> 00:09:39.895
Back to the father.

118
00:09:39.895 --> 00:09:49.895
[MUSIC]

119
00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:01.774
How has the music not changed here?

120
00:10:01.774 --> 00:10:06.880
And watch out, it will take you by force.

121
00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.381
The boy is terrified.

122
00:10:09.381 --> 00:10:13.987
[MUSIC]

123
00:10:13.987 --> 00:10:14.951
Vocal range.

124
00:10:14.951 --> 00:10:22.636
[MUSIC]

125
00:10:22.636 --> 00:10:23.914
Back to the narrator.

126
00:10:23.914 --> 00:10:32.520
[MUSIC]

127
00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.578
It arrives at the end with
the doctor awaiting him.

128
00:10:35.578 --> 00:10:41.840
[MUSIC]

129
00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.450
The horse stops.

130
00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:53.450
[MUSIC]

131
00:11:01.521 --> 00:11:03.510
Not bad for an 18 year old.

132
00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:04.980
Well, how did you do?

133
00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:07.160
Let me give you a chance
to think about it.

134
00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:08.734
Think about it for a moment.

135
00:11:12.414 --> 00:11:17.856
Well rather than just have me give
you the answers, why not submit yours

136
00:11:17.856 --> 00:11:23.220
in the form of a quiz, a reinforcement
quiz at the end of this segment.

137
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:30.760
Well, as mentioned Schubert's Erlkonig,
because of the extraordinary

138
00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:34.720
drama of this song, became the best
known art song of the 19th century.

139
00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:41.930
Painted and repainted and rearranged by
almost anyone who had access to a piano.

140
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:45.330
What had started out as
private domestic music

141
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:49.770
in the midst of a middle
class Schubertiad became so

142
00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:52.540
popular that it couldn't be
contained within a living room.

143
00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:56.490
It had to be moved outside and
onto the large concert stage.

144
00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:03.770
Here on the screen you see the musical
contents of a program that

145
00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:09.380
concert pianist Clara Schumann played
in 1862 in the Erard concert hall,

146
00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:11.700
a large public hall in Paris.

147
00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.550
We needn't go through
all the program here,

148
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:19.580
in which Clara was featured
as a soloist and accompanist.

149
00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:24.057
But you see that Schubert's
show-stopping Erlkoenig was saved for

150
00:12:24.057 --> 00:12:27.374
a rousing conclusion at
the end of the first half and

151
00:12:27.374 --> 00:12:31.990
Robert Schumann's piano collection
Carnaval at the very end.

152
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:38.010
So let's move on in our discussion of the
art song now to Robert and Clara Schumann.
