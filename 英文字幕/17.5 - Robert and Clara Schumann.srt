00:00:00.305 --> 00:00:10.305
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:13.800
Here we see an early photograph.

3
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.509
A daguerreotype of the 1840s
showing Clara and Robert Schumann.

4
00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:22.661
They're music history's only power couple,

5
00:00:22.661 --> 00:00:25.820
each a powerful creator in his or
her own right.

6
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.820
Robert Schumann went to university
the prestigious University

7
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.390
of Heidelberg in western
Germany to study law.

8
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.900
Then, as now parents thought
law was a safe profession.

9
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.870
And Schumann did come away
with one unique distinction.

10
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.940
He lived in Heidelberg as
a law student for a year, but

11
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.210
failed to attend a single class.

12
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.370
He just played around with music.

13
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.460
So music was indeed his true calling.

14
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.540
And off he went to Leipzig, Germany.

15
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.720
And he went there to study piano with
the eminent piano teacher Frederique Vica

16
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.400
who just happened to have
a beautiful daughter named Clara

17
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.020
who just happened to be
a child protege as a pianist.

18
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.490
Clara, by the age of eleven,
had already performed in public in Paris.

19
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.290
Robert well he was a nobody.

20
00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.010
Young Clara she was
an international sensation.

21
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.880
You may know the story
despite the strenuous and

22
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.140
legal objects that father
Frederick put in their way.

23
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.020
Robert and Clara were married.

24
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.740
In 1840, he was 30, she was about 20.

25
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.040
Soon Clara bore Robert eight children.

26
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.380
Here they are,
all gathered together in a Google Doodle.

27
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:51.630
But look, look at the toll that it took,
Clara now 15 years later.

28
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.804
Here they are side by side.

29
00:01:53.804 --> 00:01:57.722
1838 and 1853.

30
00:01:57.722 --> 00:02:04.690
As to Robert here he is at comparable
ages to the earlier slides with Clara.

31
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.140
As you may know he suffered
from bipolar disorder and

32
00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.530
gradually disintegrated mentally.

33
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.070
The climax of which was, pursued by
what he thought were demonic voices,

34
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.190
he jumped into the Rhine River
near Dusseldorf.

35
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.020
Well, he was pulled to
safety by fishermen but

36
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.790
he spent the next three years in a mental
institution at his own volition,

37
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.200
where he died in 1856 at the age of 46.

38
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.020
Perhaps as a result of his
sometimes unstable mind,

39
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.380
Robert was something of a streak composer.

40
00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.080
Maybe it's all too easy to say that well,
when he was in his manic phase,

41
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.080
he would only write one kind of music.

42
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.820
Only write keyboard music, or only write
chamber music, or only write songs.

43
00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.060
But it does seem that way.

44
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:59.494
It does appear at least that almost all
of the songs cluster around 1838-1840.

45
00:02:59.494 --> 00:03:04.387
And we'll investigate
one in just a minute.

46
00:03:04.387 --> 00:03:08.421
During this period the 1820s and 1830s,

47
00:03:08.421 --> 00:03:13.895
composers would sometimes take
a group of poems on a single topic and

48
00:03:13.895 --> 00:03:17.850
set them all together as a unified group.

49
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.210
We call this a song cycle.

50
00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:25.880
A song cycle is similar in concept in,
in pop music to a concept album,

51
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.630
say by the Beatles as with
the Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.

52
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.320
Concept album.

53
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.330
A group of songs that tell a story or
tie together in some way or another.

54
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.370
One such song cycle is entitled
Frau in Lieben und -Leben,

55
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.950
A Woman's Love and Life.

56
00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.840
Here the poet, Adelbert von Chamisso,

57
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.060
depicts the emotions of a young
woman as she falls in love.

58
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.610
Becomes engaged and is married.

59
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.110
Our composer has taken eight poems and
set them as a group.

60
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.670
Perhaps cuz the text here mirror events
in the true life romance of Robert and

61
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:05.810
Clara Schumann.

62
00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.324
The cycle dates from 1840 and
the two were finally married in 1840.

63
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.770
Both Robert and Clara Schumann
wrote things other than liegers.

64
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:18.480
She wrote chamber music and songs.

65
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.760
He wrote chamber music,
symphonies and even operas.

66
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.190
So Clara too was a composer,
at least before she met Robert.

67
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.570
But marriage seems to have
brought her career as a composer.

68
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:32.720
To an end.

69
00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.450
Here's what Clara wrote in
her diary at that time.

70
00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.400
Quote, I once believed that I
possessed creative talent, but

71
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.740
I have given up this idea.

72
00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.600
A woman must not dare to compose.

73
00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.380
There has never been a woman able to
do so, should I expect to be that one?

74
00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:54.120
End quote.

75
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.330
Was Clara selling herself short here?

76
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.080
Did she not have the capacity
to compose as well as Robert,

77
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.250
to compose as well as her
best male contemporaries?

78
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.860
Was it the lack of opportunity and
encouragement and

79
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.170
ultimately eight children
that held her back?

80
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.840
Well you be the judge.

81
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:18.640
Let's go do something of a back-to-back
comparison of a song by Clara and

82
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.170
one by Robert.

83
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:23.930
But for this to be a real test you
shouldn't know who composed which.

84
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:29.370
So I've chosen two songs, each set
to a lyric poem and each about love.

85
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.620
Again, I'm not gonna
tell you who wrote which.

86
00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.486
Is the composer Robert,
or is the composer Clara?

87
00:05:36.486 --> 00:05:40.480
You identify the composer.

88
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.290
And can you,
in fact identify a female composer?

89
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.860
Does music have a female or
feminine quality to it?

90
00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.920
Might it be less good, or
might it be more good in quality?

91
00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.810
Okay, let's look at our text again.

92
00:05:55.845 --> 00:06:02.970
Anyway, we're gonna concentrate here on
song number four of this cycle Du Ring

93
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:09.090
an meinem Finger, Oh,
You Ring on My Finger.

94
00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:14.690
The woman has just been married and she
stares down rapturously at her new ring.

95
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:19.240
As you can see,
there are five strophes to this lead, and

96
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:24.530
we would expect the composer to set it
in strophic form, changing the text.

97
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:29.310
But continually repeating the music for
each new strophe.

98
00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.520
But as you can see,
our mystery composer here doesn't do that.

99
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:40.489
He or she repeats the music in a way that
creates another well known musical form,

100
00:06:40.489 --> 00:06:44.691
and that is,
just looking at the letters there,

101
00:06:44.691 --> 00:06:48.807
that is, well, A B A C A,
Rondo form of course.

102
00:06:48.807 --> 00:06:52.428
Rondo form, with a piano coda.

103
00:06:52.428 --> 00:06:54.610
And that's a bit of a surprise.

104
00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:55.590
That's a bit of a surprise.

105
00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.810
And what do you think of this text?

106
00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:03.880
Let's focus now on our text and
in red you see strophe four

107
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.160
clearly it was written in
the days before sexual equality.

108
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.620
Quote, I will serve him,
I will live for him,

109
00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.720
I will belong to him entirely, and so on.

110
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:19.770
Wow, I'd never get away
with that in my house.

111
00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.930
And notice that this strophe four in red

112
00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:26.340
really is the musical
high point of the song.

113
00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.890
So let me play a little
bit at the keyboard here.

114
00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:32.660
Play a little bit of the A material.

115
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.110
And then the B and so on.

116
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:37.093
Here's the A section.

117
00:07:37.093 --> 00:07:47.093
[MUSIC]

118
00:07:59.886 --> 00:08:02.718
Okay here comes b.

119
00:08:02.718 --> 00:08:12.718
[MUSIC]

120
00:08:16.795 --> 00:08:20.752
And then eventually go back to a.

121
00:08:20.752 --> 00:08:30.752
[MUSIC]

122
00:08:43.623 --> 00:08:46.506
And that brings us to
the contrasting c section,

123
00:08:46.506 --> 00:08:51.374
the most dramatic in terms of range,
has the highest range, the loudest volume.

124
00:08:51.374 --> 00:08:55.169
It's the most dissonant,
this is the climax of the song.

125
00:08:55.169 --> 00:09:05.169
[MUSIC]

126
00:09:08.918 --> 00:09:16.075
And coming off of the climax,

127
00:09:16.075 --> 00:09:20.373
with the retard.

128
00:09:20.373 --> 00:09:25.547
And then back to [INAUDIBLE].

129
00:09:25.547 --> 00:09:27.462
And so on.

130
00:09:30.921 --> 00:09:34.542
So again the climax
there is the c section,

131
00:09:34.542 --> 00:09:39.471
where listeners learn that
this singer is just absolutely

132
00:09:39.471 --> 00:09:44.220
thrilled to be delighted by
her subservient position.

133
00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:47.370
So that's a bit of
the background in this art song.

134
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:51.180
Let's hear song a, from beginning to end.

135
00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:56.300
And for this and our second mystery piece,
we're going to move from a concert hall

136
00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:00.009
and we'll have better acoustics and
we'll meet our guest.

137
00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:05.540
So here we are, in Yale's Sudner Hall,

138
00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:08.220
little bit better acoustics than
what we usually have in the studio,

139
00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:13.590
and we have a guest with us today,
it is our own Sylvia Leath.

140
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:16.629
So Sylvia, tell us please,
where do you come from?

141
00:10:16.629 --> 00:10:18.464
>> I'm from Bethesda, Maryland.

142
00:10:18.464 --> 00:10:22.577
>> Bethesda, Maryland, and
obviously, you're a singer, so

143
00:10:22.577 --> 00:10:25.910
when did you first start
taking singing lessons?

144
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.110
>> I started taking lessons probably
when I was in middle school,

145
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:33.860
I did a lot of musical theater, and
then when I was in high school I started

146
00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:38.390
studying with a teacher who
taught classical technique.

147
00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:42.539
And I started doing classical
repertoire and that was when I was 14.

148
00:10:42.539 --> 00:10:47.720
Most teachers won't take on
students who are younger than 16,

149
00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:51.393
15, 14, because before that the body and

150
00:10:51.393 --> 00:10:56.214
the voice is not really mature
enough to work with, I guess.

151
00:10:56.214 --> 00:11:00.449
And I think 14 is supposed to be
considered a little bit young for

152
00:11:00.449 --> 00:11:06.003
starting, a lot of my friends at Yale who
do opera started when they were 16 or 17.

153
00:11:06.003 --> 00:11:06.667
>> Uh-huh, really?

154
00:11:06.667 --> 00:11:07.713
That's very interesting.

155
00:11:07.713 --> 00:11:11.097
So singers really don't start
studying classical music

156
00:11:11.097 --> 00:11:14.418
seriously until really their
advanced teenage years.

157
00:11:14.418 --> 00:11:17.799
And it probably, as Sylvia was saying, has
to do with the length of the vocal cord

158
00:11:17.799 --> 00:11:20.367
and the development of the vocal cord and
that sort of thing.

159
00:11:20.367 --> 00:11:25.373
So here you are now at Yale University and
what year are you?

160
00:11:25.373 --> 00:11:26.040
>> I'm junior.

161
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:26.586
>> You're a junior.

162
00:11:26.586 --> 00:11:27.745
Your third year here.

163
00:11:27.745 --> 00:11:29.085
And what's your major?

164
00:11:29.085 --> 00:11:29.867
>> I'm a German major.

165
00:11:29.867 --> 00:11:30.867
>> German major.

166
00:11:30.867 --> 00:11:35.859
Well that's good for us because we've
obviously got some German lieder to deal

167
00:11:35.859 --> 00:11:41.242
with today, and you'll be able to execute
that diction just perfectly, I'm sure.

168
00:11:41.242 --> 00:11:42.117
>> I hope so.

169
00:11:42.117 --> 00:11:47.873
>> So we're going to start now,
I think we're going to go ahead and

170
00:11:47.873 --> 00:11:52.353
visit our friends Robert and
Clara Schumann, and

171
00:11:52.353 --> 00:11:56.962
we're going to have first song a,
and then song b.

172
00:11:56.962 --> 00:12:06.962
[MUSIC]

173
00:14:17.285 --> 00:14:21.830
Now song b, with lyrics by
Friedrich Ruckert in four strophes.

174
00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:27.860
As you can see here I've
heightened the word nichts 0.

175
00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:29.790
In the first three strophes of this poem,

176
00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:33.710
the lady tells us what she
doesn't want to be loved for.

177
00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:37.800
Oh don't love me for my beauty, and
no don't love me for my youth, and

178
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.980
no don't love me for my money.

179
00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:44.580
And finally in the fourth stanza,
don't love me for any of these, but

180
00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:48.260
yes just love me for love,
just for love alone.

181
00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.510
So nicht and ja are the keywords here.

182
00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:54.250
And each time they appear, they do so

183
00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:59.170
in the context of a shocking
minor chord insertion.

184
00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:02.416
I'll play it at the piano.

185
00:15:03.917 --> 00:15:12.712
[MUSIC]

186
00:15:12.712 --> 00:15:14.717
So again.

187
00:15:14.717 --> 00:15:23.544
[MUSIC]

188
00:15:23.544 --> 00:15:26.910
So listeners will wanna be
on the look out for that.

189
00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:30.490
Also notice in the song that although
it's strophic, the music for

190
00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:32.600
each strophic is slightly modified.

191
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:37.830
And so we have here what's called
obviously modified strophic form.

192
00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:42.696
So I think we can see on the screen here,
by the s's I mean strophe one and

193
00:15:42.696 --> 00:15:46.995
strophe two, slightly modified strophe
three, slightly modified and so on,

194
00:15:46.995 --> 00:15:48.427
there are four strophes.

195
00:15:48.427 --> 00:15:51.383
And a piano coda at the end,
and how does this operate?

196
00:15:51.383 --> 00:15:56.039
Well you can see by the musical
examples there Let's go on to

197
00:15:56.039 --> 00:16:00.980
the last four measures of each and
I'll play them here.

198
00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:04.860
It's really a question of changing
the rhythm towards the end and

199
00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:08.380
changing the course of
the melody towards the end.

200
00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:10.630
I think you'll be able
to hear the difference.

201
00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:15.272
Here's the last four
measures of the top example

202
00:16:15.272 --> 00:16:22.578
[MUSIC]

203
00:16:22.578 --> 00:16:26.640
And then, the last four
measures of the bottom example.

204
00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:35.431
[MUSIC]

205
00:16:35.431 --> 00:16:40.530
Slightly different, slight variation
there, modified the musical line.

206
00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:43.690
And two other points here.

207
00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:50.790
Notice by this slide that the
accompaniment here is rather complicated,

208
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:53.228
rather dense by the standards of the lied.

209
00:16:53.228 --> 00:16:57.280
It's good counterpoint,
remember both Robert and

210
00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:01.090
Clara Schumann had spent a great
deal of time in the city of Leipzig.

211
00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:03.980
She grew up there and
the two were married there.

212
00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:08.400
And what composer spent the bulk
of his career in Leipzig?

213
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.560
Well yes, J S Bach.

214
00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:15.433
So indeed, the music and the spirit
of Bach with its counterpoint and

215
00:17:15.433 --> 00:17:20.485
chromaticism in the inner lines hovers
over the music of the Schumann.

216
00:17:20.485 --> 00:17:23.642
Here's the Bach-like chromaticism.

217
00:17:27.264 --> 00:17:35.210
[MUSIC]

218
00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:39.539
You can see that on the screen with
the rising blue lines, now once again.

219
00:17:39.539 --> 00:17:41.001
[MUSIC]

220
00:17:41.001 --> 00:17:42.708
And then down a little bit lower.

221
00:17:42.708 --> 00:17:48.001
[MUSIC]

222
00:17:48.001 --> 00:17:56.023
And then finally this idea of consonance
to dissonance that occurs in the coda.

223
00:17:56.023 --> 00:18:02.664
We have music moving from a dissonance to
a consonance all by chromatic half-steps.

224
00:18:02.664 --> 00:18:08.781
The bass holds the note down here, [SOUND]
and the upper parts which are here.

225
00:18:08.781 --> 00:18:12.705
[MUSIC]

226
00:18:12.705 --> 00:18:13.680
Slide in this fashion.

227
00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:15.805
[MUSIC]

228
00:18:15.805 --> 00:18:20.260
Dissonance to consonant here.

229
00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:25.280
An intensity and
then ultimately a very pleasing ending.

230
00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.303
All right, that's a bit of song b.

231
00:18:30.303 --> 00:18:34.431
Let's go back now and hear our guest,

232
00:18:34.431 --> 00:18:39.600
Sylvia Leith,
as she performs for us, song b.

233
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:46.323

00:18:46.323 --> 00:18:56.323

240
00:20:57.567 --> 00:21:01.680
>> So which song was by Robert Schumann
and which was by Clara Schumann?

241
00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.140
Could you tell the difference?

242
00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:04.940
Was one better than the other?

243
00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:08.330
Was there a feminine touch
in the music in any way?

244
00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:12.111
Aside from that,
which did you like better and why?

245
00:21:12.111 --> 00:21:16.750
Well, there are two quizzes here
at the end of this segment.

246
00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:21.280
One asking you to tell us which composer

247
00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:25.480
wrote which song and
which song you preferred.

248
00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:32.260
And the other quiz asks you to review
in effect the following important

249
00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.140
ten terms from this session.

250
00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:40.310
And to tell us where we
are in this session,

251
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:43.544
let me play this, a final cadence.
