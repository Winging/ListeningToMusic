[MUSIC]

2
00:00:22.641 --> 00:00:26.960
How do we communicate one
human being to another?

3
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.220
Sometimes we do it through spoken words.

4
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.080
Sometimes through signs or symbols,
algebraic letters and numbers,

5
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.095
for example.

6
00:00:34.095 --> 00:00:37.510
Or sometimes just through
gestures without words,

7
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.580
as is true of the communication or
messages sent to us by a mime.

8
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.210
Here we see the famous Marcel Marceau,

9
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.220
silently communicating two
very different emotions.

10
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:55.110
Sometimes gestures are accompanied
by music and dance, as we see here.

11
00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.630
Gestures and dance are at the heart of
a communicative art we call ballet.

12
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.120
The ballerina acts out the meaning
of the ballet through gestures and

13
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.910
dance, the meaning of the story.

14
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.060
Animals in the animal kingdom,
dolphins, whales, birds and

15
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.430
others well, they communicate by sounds.

16
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.450
Sounds that sometimes seem very similar
to what we humans call music, but

17
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.920
humans usually communicate
through spoken language

18
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.130
as I'm communicating with you now.

19
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.810
And here is how it works.

20
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.415
Over time, a group of people,

21
00:01:27.415 --> 00:01:31.880
let's say all the people living on
the island of Japan or in France,

22
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.800
they will agree upon the meaning of
a set of phonemes, a set of sounds.

23
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.380
And they place these phonemes in an order,
in a sequence that forms a sentence,

24
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.970
a unit of sense that makes sense to
those who understand this language.

25
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.950
These organized phonemes
communicate meaning and

26
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.630
feelings, anxiety, fear,
joy, sadness, whatever.

27
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.940
The sounds of classical music,
well they also communicate, of course.

28
00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.620
They too communicate anxiety,
fear, joy, sadness.

29
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.520
And when these sounds, the meaning of
which we've all come to agree upon

30
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.850
commonly are strung together,
this music too communicates to us.

31
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.330
When meaning filled sounds
come in a purposeful order,

32
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.460
such music can narrate a story,
tell a tale.

33
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.960
A story about an event in the life
of a hero, or of a people, or

34
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:29.930
maybe of a sequence of events,
human or, as experienced in nature.

35
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.310
When such a story is told exclusively
through instrumental music,

36
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.490
what we've created is
called program music.

37
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.640
Now, the art song or Lied that we
just studied in an earlier session,

38
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.900
well, that's not program music
because there are lyrics there.

39
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.850
There's a text that tell us a story.

40
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.016
Ballet is not program music
because the acting and

41
00:02:53.016 --> 00:02:57.160
the pantomiming of the dancers suggest
the meaning of the story as well.

42
00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.790
So program music is purely
instrumental music, thus,

43
00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.519
a definition of program music.

44
00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.570
Program music is instrumental music,
usually written for

45
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.640
a symphony orchestra,
that seeks to re-create in sound

46
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.330
the events portrayed in some extra-musical
source, a story, a legend a play,

47
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.820
a novel or even an historical
event such as a military battle.

48
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.800
Well how about some examples Greg?

49
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.810
Okay, likely you've heard for
example of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture

50
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.540
in which Tchaikovsky tries to
recreate events in music of

51
00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.240
the Battle of Borodino between Napoleon's
troops and the Russians in 1812 or

52
00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.290
the story of Romeo and Juliet as retold
through music, again, by Tchaikovsky.

53
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.430
Or Mendelssohn's overture
to Shakespeare's play,

54
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.020
A Midsummer Night's Dream in which
the composer attempts to capture,

55
00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.540
in sound,
the events that unfold in that play.

56
00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.450
The 19th century was a high
watermark of program music, and

57
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.470
many composers used it as
a better form of communication,

58
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.850
a way to communicate better with
the listener, music as narrative.

59
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.915
As composer Franz Liszt
said about program music,

60
00:04:19.915 --> 00:04:23.226
and let me grab my note card here.

61
00:04:23.226 --> 00:04:24.813
This is what he said,

62
00:04:24.813 --> 00:04:30.811
Program music protects the listener from
a wrong interpretation of the music and

63
00:04:30.811 --> 00:04:35.590
directs his attention to the poetic
idea of the whole end quote.

64
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.610
But not every composer was taken
with the notion of program music.

65
00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.480
Johannes Brahms wrote no program music.

66
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.080
He didn't want his music to tell a story.

67
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.610
Maybe he thought program
music was too simple,

68
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.670
or naive, or too restrictive of
the imagination of the listener.

69
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.990
Brahms wanted only to communicate
feelings and sensations.

70
00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.810
This sort of music,
as opposed to program music,

71
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.700
came to be called Absolute music,
Pure music, if you will.

72
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.388
You can see here a definition of it.

73
00:05:11.932 --> 00:05:14.611
But let's stick with program music and

74
00:05:14.611 --> 00:05:17.461
find out how it came to be and
how it works.
