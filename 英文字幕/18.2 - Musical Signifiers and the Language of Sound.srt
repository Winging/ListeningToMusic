[MUSIC]

2
00:00:10.328 --> 00:00:12.580
Let me play something for
you and see what you think.

3
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.320
Let me create a short story and
put a little bit of music to it.

4
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.200
So let's say one day, there was a boy.

5
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:26.156
Skipping through a forest,

6
00:00:26.156 --> 00:00:31.620
bright sunny summer day.

7
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:32.747
[MUSIC]

8
00:00:32.747 --> 00:00:39.701
Then, cloud came over and
wind came up, starting to rain.

9
00:00:39.701 --> 00:00:44.379
[MUSIC]

10
00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:45.980
A burst of lightning and thunder.

11
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.218
[MUSIC]

12
00:00:50.218 --> 00:00:51.959
And there, in the dark rainy forest.

13
00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:54.838
[MUSIC]

14
00:00:54.838 --> 00:01:01.188
A bear appears.
[MUSIC]

15
00:01:01.188 --> 00:01:02.906
A bear started to chase the boy.

16
00:01:02.906 --> 00:01:12.241
[MUSIC]

17
00:01:12.241 --> 00:01:19.235
And caught him and killed him.

18
00:01:19.235 --> 00:01:26.425
Always friends, they came together and

19
00:01:26.425 --> 00:01:31.722
carried his body to a chapel.

20
00:01:31.722 --> 00:01:36.672
When they were in the chapel,

21
00:01:36.672 --> 00:01:39.644
all of the friends

22
00:01:39.644 --> 00:01:42.487
[MUSIC]

23
00:01:42.487 --> 00:01:44.566
We gotta sing a hymn to the boy.

24
00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:51.367
[MUSIC]

25
00:01:51.367 --> 00:01:57.382
While they're in the chapel,
the sun came out.

26
00:01:57.382 --> 00:02:02.002
[MUSIC]

27
00:02:02.002 --> 00:02:08.444
And the spirit of the boy descended and

28
00:02:08.444 --> 00:02:12.080
then rose to the sky.

29
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.080
Silly, I know, but
that's the essence of program music.

30
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.850
Over time,
composers developed sonic signifiers.

31
00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.070
Triple it, major key for happy, maybe some
crashing chords and dissonant chords for

32
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.340
disruption, rising chromaticism,
minor, that sort of thing.

33
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.450
Steady minor tempo for a funeral march.

34
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.010
These signifiers we have come to
understand as conveying meaning in music.

35
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.970
Done tastefully, stringing these together,
we can make a story.

36
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.310
If you do it tastefully, as I suggest,
well then it can be effective.

37
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.170
Done to excess, I suppose it can
degenerate into cartoon music or

38
00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.510
video music.

39
00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.140
Utilitarian music rather than
the supposed high art music.

40
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.760
When did we get this language of music?

41
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.220
When did we all start to speak or
least understand this language of music?

42
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.550
Well, it goes back to the renaissance and
the madrigal.

43
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.250
Remember how the composers of
the madrigal focused on particular

44
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.750
words of the text and
tried to create in music?

45
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.640
Onomatopoeic sounds that would match it.

46
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.790
A sound that would sound out the meaning
of the word, words like buzz or smooth.

47
00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:32.220
In the 17th century, the baroque era, this
language of music became so well known.

48
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.640
That the text could be stripped away and

49
00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.700
the listener would still understand the
meaning of the various musical gestures.

50
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.580
Now the go-to piece here, of course,

51
00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.560
is Vivaldi's The Seasons and
the Spring Concerto.

52
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.880
Let's review this piece and
do so in the form of a quiz.

53
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.770
You'll remember Vivaldi created
a series of events in nature and

54
00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.660
placed them in a particular order to
tell a simple story about a spring day.

55
00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.380
So, I've extracted the important
musical signifiers and scrambled them.

56
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.340
Let me play them for you,
and you unscramble them.

57
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.190
You place the musical excerpts
in the correct order.

58
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.590
But how do we know what
the correct order is?

59
00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.535
Because that's the order In
which Vivaldi presented them.

60
00:04:20.535 --> 00:04:26.004
Okay, so you can see here on the screen,
we have four event.

61
00:04:26.004 --> 00:04:29.890
A storm, a river, a clearing, and

62
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:35.130
that clearing of the atmosphere could
come before or after a storm, and birds.

63
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.857
So I'm just gonna start
up at the top here, and

64
00:04:38.857 --> 00:04:44.604
I'm going to play the first audio clip,
and we will see what you think.

65
00:04:44.604 --> 00:04:54.604
[MUSIC]

66
00:04:56.158 --> 00:04:59.710
Okay, what's the next event?

67
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.915
You identify the next event.

68
00:05:01.915 --> 00:05:11.934
[MUSIC]

69
00:05:11.934 --> 00:05:12.491
Okay.

70
00:05:12.491 --> 00:05:16.915
Next event or entity or
item moving down to this one.

71
00:05:16.915 --> 00:05:26.915
[MUSIC]

72
00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:39.610
And now the last one.

73
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:49.610
[MUSIC]

74
00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.328
Well, how did you do?

75
00:05:55.328 --> 00:05:56.385
Did you get them all right?

76
00:05:56.385 --> 00:05:57.952
Did you get them in the right order?

77
00:05:57.952 --> 00:06:00.844
Well to find out,
we'll have to take the next recap quiz.
