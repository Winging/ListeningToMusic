[MUSIC]

2
00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:09.805
Now we come to the iconic
piece of program music,

3
00:00:09.805 --> 00:00:15.650
something of a thunderbolt of program
music, Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique.

4
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.910
Before we look at this work by Berlioz,
let's discuss the various types, or

5
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.570
genres, of program music that we
might experience in a concert hall.

6
00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:26.910
We've listed them here on a slide.

7
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.730
As you can see, we have a tone poem,
sometimes called symphonic poem,

8
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.760
a one movement piece for orchestra.

9
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.870
Actually, we've already experienced
this beginning of our course,

10
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.370
Richard Strauss' Also sprach Zarathustra.

11
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.430
We could mention Romeo and

12
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.290
Juliet by Tchaikovsky,
Night on Bald Mountain by Mussorgsky.

13
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.012
Then there is the genre
of the program symphony,

14
00:00:50.012 --> 00:00:52.850
a multi-movement composition for
orchestra.

15
00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.260
Symphonie fantastique, Berlioz, the Faust
Symphony of Liszt, Sheherazade even,

16
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.030
perhaps, of Rimsky-Korsakov.

17
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.950
They would be all examples
of the program symphony.

18
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:10.100
And finally the dramatic overture that
could open an opera, or open a play,

19
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.600
or even open a festival.

20
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.530
They are, again,
as with the tone poem, one movement.

21
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.050
The William Tell overture, for example,
opens the opera of that name by Rossini.

22
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.300
The 1812 Overture of Tchaikovsky
commemorated the opening

23
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.752
of a convocation in honor of that
event in Russia in the 1860s.

24
00:01:32.752 --> 00:01:37.657
And finally, of course, Midsummer Night's
Dream, well, that's an overture by

25
00:01:37.657 --> 00:01:41.470
Mendelssohn that opened a Shakespearean
play of that same name.

26
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.140
Well, let's start with what's arguably
the strangest and most bizarre example of

27
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.010
program music, again,
Hector Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique.

28
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.710
Obviously, it's an example
of a program symphony.

29
00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.620
Let's start with an excerpt
from this symphony.

30
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.392
As you listen, think about what you feel.

31
00:02:02.392 --> 00:02:06.663
What Berlioz is trying to
depict here is a scene,

32
00:02:06.663 --> 00:02:11.257
a scene that is part of
the program of this symphony.

33
00:02:11.257 --> 00:02:13.776
What is he trying to communicate here?

34
00:02:13.776 --> 00:02:16.435
Where are we?

35
00:02:16.435 --> 00:02:26.435
[MUSIC]

36
00:02:42.774 --> 00:02:47.059
Okay, well let's, let's fade
that out here just for a moment.

37
00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:49.600
And let me give you a hint.

38
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.480
Where does Berlioz take us musically?

39
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.700
To the scene on the left, or
to the scene on the right?

40
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.706
You choose.

41
00:02:56.706 --> 00:03:05.610
[MUSIC]

42
00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.591
So here we have two paintings
from the same period,

43
00:03:09.591 --> 00:03:12.565
one by Constable, the other by Goya.

44
00:03:12.565 --> 00:03:17.450
Which sort of atmosphere was Berlioz
trying to conjure up through music,

45
00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:18.485
left or right?

46
00:03:18.485 --> 00:03:22.618
[MUSIC]

47
00:03:22.618 --> 00:03:24.742
Well, the atmosphere on the right.

48
00:03:24.742 --> 00:03:28.810
The music that you just heard is
his vision of a descent into hell.

49
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.910
And I think you'd agree that we heard
descending music with strange sounds,

50
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.190
the cacophony of hell.

51
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.690
But before we proceed,
a quick word about Hector Berlioz.

52
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.160
Berlioz was born in
the south of France and

53
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.370
was trained in classical literature and
basic science, but not in music.

54
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.810
Of all the great composers, he was
the only one who could not play the piano.

55
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.710
He could only strum out
a few chords on the guitar.

56
00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.220
His father, well, he was a village doctor.

57
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.020
He sent the young Berlioz up to Paris
to the prestigious Ecole de medecine,

58
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.760
Medical School on the Left Bank.

59
00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.610
And it's still here today,
near the Sorbonne.

60
00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.800
And here's how it looked
in the 19th century.

61
00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.608
But Berlioz was no fan of the horrific
dissections that he had to witness as

62
00:04:18.608 --> 00:04:20.214
a medical school student.

63
00:04:20.214 --> 00:04:23.767
And even in his memoirs, he talks about
jumping out a window during one of them.

64
00:04:23.767 --> 00:04:27.783
So after a year, he dropped out of
med school to give himself over to

65
00:04:27.783 --> 00:04:30.294
the study of music at the Conservatory and

66
00:04:30.294 --> 00:04:35.800
the Opera House, both across the river
there, on the Right Bank of Paris.

67
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.640
Here's a view of a concert in
progress at the Conservatory.

68
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.040
Although always the rebel and contrarian,
Berlioz did manage to win a Prix de Rome,

69
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.040
a composition prize.

70
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.950
But he really preferred Paris to Rome,
mostly for the music and the theater.

71
00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.080
Indeed, in the second and
third decades of the 19th century,

72
00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.590
Shakespeare was taking
the stage of Europe by storm.

73
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.630
And in 1827, a group of Shakespearean
actors came to Paris to play both

74
00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.450
Hamlet and Romeo and Juliet.

75
00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.510
Berlioz went, and he was smitten.

76
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.290
Here's where he went,
to the Theater Odeon.

77
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.460
That's the outside of it as it
existed in the 19th century.

78
00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.750
Now let's go inside, as it looks today.

79
00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.790
I can personally attest, there's
very little leg room in those seats.

80
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.200
Anyway, Berli goes, Berlioz goes into
this theater, sees the Shakespeare and

81
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:37.030
falls in love with Shakespeare and
with the leading lady, who was playing

82
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:43.800
Ophelia to Hamlet, and Juliet to Romeo,
the young Irish actress Harriet Smithson.

83
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.320
Here she is in a portrait of that time.

84
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.990
Berlioz, well, he tried to meet Harriet.

85
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.620
He went to her dressing room.

86
00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.240
He followed after her.

87
00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.850
In modern parlance, he stalked her,

88
00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:00.260
almost like a crazed fan would
stalk a Hollywood starlet today.

89
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:07.160
And Harriet, well, she was a star, but
she was terrified and rejected Berlioz.

90
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.820
Rejected, Berlioz began to contemplate and
execute an artistic response,

91
00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:18.015
a multi-movement symphony that told
the tale of an imaginary, dreamlike,

92
00:06:18.015 --> 00:06:22.980
ill-fated love in which the stalker
ends up killing the young woman.

93
00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:27.930
If nothing else,
you can see that Berlioz is building here,

94
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.210
at first,
on the true story of his love for

95
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:36.100
Harriet, and then his imagination
takes over, a vivid ima,

96
00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:41.170
imagination that leads to a fantastic or,
in this case, fantastical story.

97
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.370
So fantastic, or fantastique,
here, doesn't mean so

98
00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.330
much that it's great, though it is great.

99
00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.150
It's fantastic in that sense.

100
00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:52.390
But it's also a fantasy.

101
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.630
Well, how did it play out,
this story in a symphony?

102
00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:00.880
Well, eventually,
Berlioz's fantastic symphony was

103
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.560
premiered at the Paris Conservatory.

104
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.040
And Harriet Smithson, who up to that time
had no idea that she was the center of

105
00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.220
the symphony,
with Harriet Smithson in attendance and

106
00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:16.880
listening, eventually during the
performance, the premiere, she caught on.

107
00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.130
As to the symphony itself, well,
it's constructed not in four, but

108
00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:25.310
in five movements,
like a five-act play of Shakespeare.

109
00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:28.020
Like his Hamlet or his Romeo and Juliet.

110
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.040
And here's something else that's new.

111
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.920
Berlioz wrote out this program and
had it printed and

112
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:39.050
handed to everyone in the audience at the
first performance of the finished work,

113
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:43.820
the first example in the history
of music of concert program notes.

114
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:45.990
Program music, program notes.

115
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.430
Let's start with the first movement, and

116
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:55.650
remember, these are Berlioz's words,
not mine.

117
00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:58.360
A young musician sees for the first time

118
00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:04.470
a woman who embodies all the charms of the
ideal being he has imagined in his dreams.

119
00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:09.059
The subject of the first movement
is the passage from this state of

120
00:08:09.059 --> 00:08:12.657
melancholy reverie to that
of delirious passion.

121
00:08:12.657 --> 00:08:16.218
What was Berlioz's vision of the beloved?

122
00:08:16.218 --> 00:08:22.174
Well, here is the musical incarnation
of her, Harriet Smithson.

123
00:08:22.174 --> 00:08:27.236
She becomes an obsession,
a musical obsession or fixation.

124
00:08:27.236 --> 00:08:30.091
An Idee fixe.

125
00:08:30.091 --> 00:08:31.450
So let me try to play this for you.

126
00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:33.714
I may need my glasses to see it,
maybe not, we'll see.

127
00:08:33.714 --> 00:08:36.233
Play the Idee fixe for
you here at the keyboard.

128
00:08:36.233 --> 00:08:46.233
[MUSIC]

129
00:08:55.295 --> 00:08:58.791
Now rising sequences,
maybe a little bit faster.

130
00:08:58.791 --> 00:09:03.514
[MUSIC]

131
00:09:03.514 --> 00:09:06.870
Now up to the top,
he begins to come off it.

132
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:16.870
[MUSIC]

133
00:09:22.032 --> 00:09:24.308
A typical romantic theme.

134
00:09:24.308 --> 00:09:29.172
It's long, it's not balanced,
no two plus two phrases here,

135
00:09:29.172 --> 00:09:33.320
as you can see by all of
the ties up there in the melody.

136
00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:37.312
It's rhythmically amorphous,
and it's pushed upward.

137
00:09:37.312 --> 00:09:39.084
It's climax-oriented,

138
00:09:39.084 --> 00:09:44.171
pushed on passionately by the ever-rising
melodic sequence, as you heard.

139
00:09:44.171 --> 00:09:46.713
Okay, now a bit of the second movement.

140
00:09:46.713 --> 00:09:51.798
Let's see where Berlioz has taken
us next in his imagination.

141
00:09:51.798 --> 00:09:53.891
We'll hear the same melody, but

142
00:09:53.891 --> 00:09:57.197
now it's altered to fit
the next scene of the story.

143
00:09:57.197 --> 00:09:58.496
But where are we?

144
00:09:58.496 --> 00:10:03.814
Again, where does Berlioz
take us in this scene?

145
00:10:03.814 --> 00:10:13.814
[MUSIC]

146
00:10:19.448 --> 00:10:20.865
Yes, we're at a dance.

147
00:10:20.865 --> 00:10:26.507
Our hero is now at a party, and
he sees the beloved across the room.

148
00:10:26.507 --> 00:10:31.069
Our beloved, the Idee fixe,
is transformed, of course.

149
00:10:31.069 --> 00:10:37.220
The melody is now changed into a more
symmetrical waltz in a clear triple meter.

150
00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:42.690
Now let's take a look
at the third movement.

151
00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:44.120
Now we're in the country.

152
00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:49.220
The artist, our musician, hears in
the distance two shepherds piping.

153
00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:54.100
He hopes that soon he
will no longer be alone.

154
00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:58.270
So the way Berlioz has set
this up is as follows.

155
00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:02.370
Onstage he has an English horn,
that's presumably Berlioz himself.

156
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.100
Offstage there is an oboe.

157
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.760
And they engage in a dialogue.

158
00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:08.600
She loves me.

159
00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.920
She loves me not.

160
00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.070
Eventually, the oboe ceases to respond,
ceases to answer.

161
00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.001
This leaves the musician alone and

162
00:11:18.001 --> 00:11:22.037
despondent, with dire
consequences to come.
