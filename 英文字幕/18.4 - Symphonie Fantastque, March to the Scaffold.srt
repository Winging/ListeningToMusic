00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.655
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:09.655 --> 00:00:13.032
As you can see by Berlioz's
description of movement four,

3
00:00:13.032 --> 00:00:15.540
things now take a turn
toward the dark side.

4
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.960
Berlioz imagines the story thusly.

5
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.990
Quote, having realized that
his love goes unrecognized,

6
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.985
the artist poisons himself with opium.

7
00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:28.330
The dose of the narcotic,

8
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:34.380
too weak to kill him, plunges him into
a sleep with the most horrible visions.

9
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.870
He dreams that he has killed his beloved,
is condemned to death,

10
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.710
led to the scaffold, and
now witnesses his own execution.

11
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.850
So this is s march,
a march to the scaffold for a beheading.

12
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.600
As a boy growing up during
the period of the Napoleonic wars,

13
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.990
Berlioz heard many military bands and
military instruments.

14
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.110
In addition to bringing the harp and
the English horn, a low oboe,

15
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.350
into the orchestra, Bers,
Berlioz also incorporated the coronet,

16
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.370
a short mellow trumpet, and
an ophicleide, an early form of the tuba.

17
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.860
Of these, the ophicleide,
the tuba was the most important,

18
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.850
because it opened the door to more low

19
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.370
brasses within the orchestra which Berlioz
uses in this march to the scaffold.

20
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.485
As we listen here focus
on the low brass sound.

21
00:01:31.485 --> 00:01:33.250
[MUSIC]

22
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:43.250
[MUSIC]

23
00:01:56.128 --> 00:01:57.269
There it is again.

24
00:01:57.269 --> 00:02:07.451
[MUSIC]

25
00:02:07.451 --> 00:02:12.137
Well the march of the condemned prisoner,
our musician, reaches the scaffold with

26
00:02:12.137 --> 00:02:15.250
growing excitement on the part
of the gathering crowd.

27
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.900
Remember, beheadings in this period
during the French revolution and

28
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.730
there after,
beheadings was a spectator sport.

29
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.250
So the musician arrives,
his head is set on the guillotine, and

30
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.990
then one last thought of his beloved.

31
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:38.120
We know that because we hear the,
the sound quietly in the clarinet.

32
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.260
Then the guillotine falls.

33
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.970
Kaboom.

34
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:48.528
Off comes the head and the crowd cheers
as signaled by triumphant brass chords.

35
00:02:48.528 --> 00:02:54.728
[MUSIC]

36
00:02:54.728 --> 00:02:56.261
There's a gathering crowd.

37
00:02:56.261 --> 00:02:58.444
[MUSIC]

38
00:02:58.444 --> 00:03:01.241
Rushing to the scaffold.

39
00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:11.241
[MUSIC]

40
00:03:29.638 --> 00:03:31.542
And the crowd cheers.

41
00:03:31.542 --> 00:03:41.542
[MUSIC]

42
00:03:46.123 --> 00:03:48.665
Well let's hear this again.

43
00:03:48.665 --> 00:03:52.740
This is program music at its best or
most extreme.

44
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.500
First a reminiscence of the beloved,
again, in the clarinet.

45
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.350
Then the fall,
sharp fall of the guillotine, and if you

46
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.940
listen very carefully, you'll hear that
Berlioz even depicts the fall of the head

47
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.650
into the basket, thump, thump, thump,
thump, at the distance of an octave.

48
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.474
A first, and last,
in the history of music.

49
00:04:13.474 --> 00:04:16.862
[MUSIC]

50
00:04:16.862 --> 00:04:18.697
The reminiscence of the beloved.

51
00:04:18.697 --> 00:04:26.742
[MUSIC]

52
00:04:26.742 --> 00:04:27.300
Guillotine.
Thump, thump.

53
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:35.761
End of our musician, end of

54
00:04:35.761 --> 00:04:43.549
movement.
