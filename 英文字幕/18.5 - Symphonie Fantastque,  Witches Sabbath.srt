00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:13.087 --> 00:00:15.838
With our protagonist musician now dead,

3
00:00:15.838 --> 00:00:19.462
we would assume that that
would be the end of the story.

4
00:00:19.462 --> 00:00:20.254
But not so.

5
00:00:20.254 --> 00:00:25.910
He and we now descend into hell
as our fantastic dream continues.

6
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.190
What does a descent into Hell sound like?

7
00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.400
Well we've already heard this music at the
beginning of our session on program music

8
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.240
and our twisting image of Francesca Goya.

9
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.760
Let's continue down and
we'll see who we meet along the way.

10
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.260
Well lo and behold there she is,
our beloved, and now look at her.

11
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.004
She's been turned into an old hag,
a crone.

12
00:00:51.004 --> 00:00:57.440
A grotesque version of former loveliness.

13
00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.930
How do we know that this is our beloved?

14
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.380
Because Berlioz's program
is very explicit,

15
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.539
very descriptive here in this fifth and
final movement.

16
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.440
Here's the program.

17
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.470
He sees himself at the witches'
sabbath surrounded by

18
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.050
a troop of frightful monsters of
all sorts gathered for his funeral.

19
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.382
The beloved melody returns but
it has lost its noble,

20
00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:27.587
modest character and is now only base,
trivial and grotesque.

21
00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:37.587
[MUSIC]

22
00:01:49.463 --> 00:01:53.350
Down further we go in our descent
until we reach the bottom of Hell.

23
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.110
And we'll know we've arrived at
the bottom when Berlioz sounds his new

24
00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.030
low brass instrument, the ophicleide or
tuba, on a long held pitch.

25
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.422
A stable pitch, which tells us that at
this point, we've reached rock bottom.

26
00:02:10.422 --> 00:02:20.422
[MUSIC]

27
00:02:23.461 --> 00:02:27.337
There's the note, the bottom.

28
00:02:27.337 --> 00:02:28.587
And then suddenly.

29
00:02:28.587 --> 00:02:31.921
[SOUND] The strangest sound.

30
00:02:31.921 --> 00:02:41.921
[MUSIC]

31
00:02:48.881 --> 00:02:52.963
Well, church bells give an odd
religious tone to the proceedings.

32
00:02:52.963 --> 00:02:57.951
And the sacrilege continues in
the music when the low brasses,

33
00:02:57.951 --> 00:03:03.047
led by the new tubas, play in
unison the melody of the Dies irae.

34
00:03:03.047 --> 00:03:07.997
The signature chant of the Roman Requiem
mass, the burial mass,

35
00:03:07.997 --> 00:03:10.796
again of the Roman Catholic church.

36
00:03:10.796 --> 00:03:15.212
A melody that belonged to the church for
at least 700 years by this time.

37
00:03:15.212 --> 00:03:18.958
And notice that at the repeat
of the opening phrase,

38
00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:22.379
the rhythmic durations
are shortened by half.

39
00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:27.921
The rhythmic durations are shortened by
half which is called rhythmic diminution.

40
00:03:27.921 --> 00:03:37.921
[MUSIC]

41
00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:49.754
Diminution.

42
00:03:49.754 --> 00:03:59.754
[MUSIC]

43
00:04:01.754 --> 00:04:05.504
Yeah, now the weirdness continues.

44
00:04:05.504 --> 00:04:08.500
Here, Berlioz shares with
us his vision of a black or

45
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.730
blasphemous mass, a parody of
the traditional Christian mass.

46
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.591
Your babies serve as communion
wafers in this hellish scene.

47
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:23.210
And Berlioz has his witches
join a bizarre dance that

48
00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:28.690
unfolds in the form of all things,
a fugue.

49
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.080
Having parodied the Roman Catholic
church with an old chant,

50
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.000
why not parody the Paris Conservatory,
the home of the old academic fugue?

51
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.074
Now a fugue that unfolds in the middle of
another composition is called a fugato,

52
00:04:43.074 --> 00:04:44.962
fugato, a short fugue.

53
00:04:44.962 --> 00:04:50.129
Let's listen as this fugato
unfolds in the middle of Hell.

54
00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:54.630
And I'll indicate the entries of
the subjects as marked here with an S.

55
00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:04.630
[MUSIC]

56
00:05:56.712 --> 00:05:59.796
And pretty soon our fugato fades out.

57
00:05:59.796 --> 00:06:03.503
But Berlioz wasn't finished with
learned counterpoint here in Hell.

58
00:06:03.503 --> 00:06:08.031
What would it sound like if
Berlioz had combined his fugue

59
00:06:08.031 --> 00:06:13.046
subject with the Dies irae in
a moment of double counterpoint?

60
00:06:13.046 --> 00:06:16.296
[MUSIC]

61
00:06:16.296 --> 00:06:19.879
Fugue subject up above,
Dies irae underneath.

62
00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:29.879
[MUSIC]

63
00:06:34.004 --> 00:06:36.795
Okay, double counterpoint.

64
00:06:36.795 --> 00:06:40.671
Now it's time for
our protagonist musician to burn in Hell.

65
00:06:40.671 --> 00:06:44.200
For this,
Berlioz would need another musical first.

66
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:52.790
What musical sound, what sound, could
produce something akin to burning wood?

67
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:54.886
How can we have a musical
gesture like that?

68
00:06:54.886 --> 00:07:02.260
Well, maybe the wood of the back
of the violin bow would suffice.

69
00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:03.685
So for this special effect,

70
00:07:03.685 --> 00:07:08.830
Berlioz requires the player to flip
the bow over and play as you see here.

71
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.170
Not with the usual horsehairs,

72
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:16.230
but with the wood on the back,
scraping it on the strings.

73
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:20.962
The direction in the score says col legno,
col legno, with the wood.

74
00:07:20.962 --> 00:07:26.409
So let's listen to the end of Symphonie
fantastique as it races towards

75
00:07:26.409 --> 00:07:31.223
an exciting conclusion beginning
with col legno technique and

76
00:07:31.223 --> 00:07:35.879
I'll point out the secants of
musical events as we proceed.

77
00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:45.879
[MUSIC]

78
00:08:59.254 --> 00:09:01.187
Well that was quite a story,

79
00:09:01.187 --> 00:09:05.350
quite a program, but
how does the story really end?

80
00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:07.530
Well, it turns out that
Berlioz did meet Harriett.

81
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:14.370
And that the two did marry and
then they were miserable ever after.

82
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:16.609
Sometimes life just doesn't imitate art.

83
00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:20.230
Hector complained of Harriet's
increasing weight, and

84
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:25.210
Harriet complained of Hector's
increasingly frequent infidelities.

85
00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:32.100
She died in 1853, and was buried, and
then reburied, or re-interred, elsewhere.

86
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.910
He died in 1869, and
was buried in a small cemetery.

87
00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:42.390
To the north of the river
there in Montmartre in Paris.

88
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:46.980
Then, for the 100th anniversary of his
death, poor Harriet was moved yet again.

89
00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:53.470
This time up to that cemetery, in the same
cemetery in Monmartre next to Hector.

90
00:09:54.510 --> 00:10:00.725
And there the two lie side by side today,
probably still squabbling.

91
00:10:00.725 --> 00:10:05.212
[LAUGH] As they say, it's quite a story.
