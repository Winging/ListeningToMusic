00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.368
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:06.368 --> 00:00:09.400
Well, there's much more we
could do with program music.

3
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.790
I'd love to introduce you to the music
of Tchaikovsky's dramatic overture,

4
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.450
Romeo and Juliet.

5
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.693
See how that sounds,
just a clip from that.

6
00:00:18.693 --> 00:00:23.020
[MUSIC]

7
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.639
And, perhaps also,
music from Tchaikovsky's, 1812 Overture.

8
00:00:28.639 --> 00:00:29.984
Just a sampler of that.

9
00:00:29.984 --> 00:00:39.984
[MUSIC]

10
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.030
Or music from Mussorgsky's,
Pictures at an Exhibition, or

11
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.025
Rimsky-Korsakov Scheherazade,
and so many others.

12
00:00:54.025 --> 00:00:58.060
But I can't because these are long pieces,
and they take a long time to play out and

13
00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.700
a long time to discuss.

14
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.330
And we're out of time.

15
00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.320
So let's end with one last

16
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.390
interactive engagement to see if
you speak fluent program music.

17
00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.340
What I mean by that, of course,
is to see if you can engage

18
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.540
in a musical conversation from
the listener's point of view.

19
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.670
Can you recognize what's being said?

20
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.750
Can you recognize what
the composer wants to say to you,

21
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.710
wants to communicate to you?

22
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.910
Let's see.
All right, so here's our quiz.

23
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.880
We have six events or
scenes, if you will, and

24
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.540
six audio clips down below, audio clips
by Beethoven, audio clip B by Grieg,

25
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.790
C Suppe, D Beethoven,
E Brahms, and F Wagner.

26
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.210
And up above,
we have six scenes or events.

27
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.310
As you can see here, we have a storm
scene, a funeral march, a calvary, or

28
00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.670
horse march, at a fast tempo,
a Sunrise in the midst of nature, Spacious

29
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.750
alpine meadow and mountains, and finally,
Triumphant pilgrims marching along a road.

30
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.770
So, let's begin.

31
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.319
I'm gonna play audio clip A, and
you match it with the scene.

32
00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:21.319
[MUSIC]

33
00:02:43.243 --> 00:02:44.140
All right, that's enough of that.

34
00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.601
Let's go onto audio clip B.

35
00:02:47.601 --> 00:02:57.601
[MUSIC]

36
00:03:12.482 --> 00:03:14.430
That's probably enough of that.

37
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.776
Now audio clip C, by Suppe.

38
00:03:17.776 --> 00:03:27.776
[MUSIC]

39
00:03:44.492 --> 00:03:45.899
Enough, that's probably enough of that.

40
00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:48.552
Let's hear some more Beethoven.

41
00:03:48.552 --> 00:03:58.552
[MUSIC]

42
00:04:16.908 --> 00:04:18.260
All right, we'll stop it there.

43
00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.722
Next is music by Brahms.

44
00:04:20.722 --> 00:04:30.722
[MUSIC]

45
00:05:01.862 --> 00:05:07.249
Okay, and then finally, music by Wagner.

46
00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:17.249
[MUSIC]

47
00:05:42.152 --> 00:05:43.035
All right.

48
00:05:43.035 --> 00:05:45.958
Well, how'd you do?

49
00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.816
Here are the answers.

50
00:05:50.881 --> 00:05:53.574
Storm scene, well,
that was music of Beethoven.

51
00:05:53.574 --> 00:05:56.670
Funeral march, well, more Beethoven.

52
00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.860
Calvary march, music by Suppe.

53
00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.870
Sunrise, music by Grieg.

54
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.200
Alpine mountains, music by Brahms,
featuring the French horn.

55
00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.362
And the Triumphant pilgrims march,

56
00:06:07.362 --> 00:06:11.210
featuring the trombones
there with Richard Wagner.

57
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.640
If you did get them correct,
congratulations.

58
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.410
You obviously understand program music.

59
00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:17.850
You got the message.

60
00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.910
You got the composer's message.
