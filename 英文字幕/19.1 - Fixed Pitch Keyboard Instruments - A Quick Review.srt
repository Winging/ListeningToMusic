[MUSIC]

2
00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.715
Western musical culture,

3
00:00:30.715 --> 00:00:35.200
is the only musical culture that
has keyed fix pitched instruments.

4
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.550
Let me say that again,
keyed fix pitch instruments.

5
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.310
What's a fixed pitch instrument?

6
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.180
Well, it's one that doesn't allow for

7
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.120
a change of pitch, doesn't allow for
a tuning, during a performance.

8
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.650
So, here's an opening quiz.

9
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.318
In the list that you
see which of the three

10
00:00:55.318 --> 00:00:58.560
instruments are fixed pitch instruments?

11
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.440
You don't have to adjust them,
while you're playing a concert.

12
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:04.830
Good.

13
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.930
Harp, Organ, and Piano.

14
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.200
With the oboe, you can blow harder or
less hard and the pitch will rise or

15
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.470
fall, same thing with the trumpet or
the trombone.

16
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.170
With both string instruments,
you can slightly extend or

17
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.690
shorten the length of string and
the sound, will get lower or higher.

18
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.500
The voice does the same thing,
with the vocal chords, lengthening or

19
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.900
shortening them.

20
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.370
The harp, of course,
doesn't use keys, so the organ and

21
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.420
piano are really the only fixed
pitch instruments with keyboards.

22
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.520
Now, other cultures have
fixed pitch instruments.

23
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.700
The Chinese, for example, have the Pipa
and the Indonesians, well, they

24
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.940
have the Indonesian Gamelan, but neither
if these, obviously, has a keyboard.

25
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.710
Only, Western music has
keyboard instruments.

26
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.030
And, Western music, has relied heavily
on keyboard instruments, indeed for

27
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.410
more than a thousand years.

28
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.910
First with the organ, and later with
the harpsichord and then with the piano.

29
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.600
The result of this heavy reliance
on fixed pitch keyboard instruments

30
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.010
to accompany voices and
other instruments, was that fixed pitch,

31
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:24.460
very precise pitch, came to be
privileged in Western musical culture.

32
00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.610
Western music doesn't slide.

33
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.560
Between pitches but
goes immediately and directly bum, bum.

34
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.520
From one exact pitch, to the next.

35
00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.220
And these pitches, have been set
out on a grid at fixed spots.

36
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.370
Western music, with its grid is more
precise in terms of melody and harmony,

37
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.040
but lets much less nuance
than non-western music.

38
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.740
Again, in Western music we have bars for
rhythm and a grid for pitch.

39
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.430
If nothing else, Western music is
comparatively rigid and fixed.

40
00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.140
As we saw in our earlier session
in medieval and renaissance music.

41
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.720
The organ has been around in the West,
with keys, for more than a thousand years

42
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.950
and, the harpsichord for more than 600,
and the piano, for more than 300.

43
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.350
Let's take a minute to review,
how the harpsichord and piano make sound.

44
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.240
You can see that, this harpsichord, from
around 1600, has only three and a half

45
00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.560
octaves to it, it's very small, very small
keyboard, very few keys, very few pitches.

46
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.665
Now here's a, layer,
somewhat bigger harpsichord,

47
00:03:40.665 --> 00:03:45.945
that allows us to see where the jacks
are located at the blue arrow.

48
00:03:45.945 --> 00:03:46.685
Now remember,

49
00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:51.825
that the harpsichord had a jack mechanism
in which small bits of plastic, well,

50
00:03:51.825 --> 00:03:56.695
of course, back in the day those small
bits of plastic were bits of crow quill.

51
00:03:56.695 --> 00:04:01.300
Small, hard bits that could be pushed up,
by a key and

52
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.210
strike a string and then slide back down.

53
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.537
You'll see, where the plectrum,
or the striker of the string,

54
00:04:10.537 --> 00:04:14.896
is located within the jack,
as we watch a quick video.

55
00:04:14.896 --> 00:04:24.896
[MUSIC]

56
00:04:36.791 --> 00:04:39.883
Pretty nifty,
[LAUGH] virtuoso performance, but

57
00:04:39.883 --> 00:04:42.600
the harpsichord did have limitations.

58
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.850
Well, what, what were they?

59
00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.190
Think about it, for a moment.

60
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.490
What couldn't the harpsichord do?

61
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.700
Well, here are some of the disadvantages.

62
00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.580
It had only one dynamic range at a time.

63
00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.840
And it couldn't shape a phrase.

64
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.990
That's particularly important,
couldn't shape a phrase.

65
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.360
It couldn't play, loud or
soft one note to the next.

66
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.270
And it couldn't play loud enough
to compete with an orchestra,

67
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.750
at least with the late classical and
early romantic orchestra,

68
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.780
because it didn't have the volume.

69
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.440
So to solve this problem of limited
volume an Italian inventor in

70
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.530
Florence created a new kind of
instrument called the pianoforte,

71
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.820
the soft loud, because it could play
both soft and loud, and instantly.

72
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.340
Here the strings were not plucked,
but struck by hammers from below.

73
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.920
And they could fall back or
escape back down after being struck.

74
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.370
Without this escapement mechanism,

75
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.930
the hammer would still be
controlled by the key.

76
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.250
You push the key down and as long as you
were pressing the key the hammer would

77
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:55.550
stay stuck up against the string and
mute the sound of the string.

78
00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:56.220
So that was no good.

79
00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:01.340
The complicated escapement
mechanism that you see

80
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.780
here allowed the string to sound and
a hammer to fall back, so

81
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.030
that it was immediately ready to strike
again when the key was pressed down again.

82
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.600
Of course, this instrument came
to be called just the piano.

83
00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.850
And here's how the inside
of it looks today.

84
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:23.796
But let's go back to
Mozart's piano of the 1780s.

85
00:06:23.796 --> 00:06:25.822
And as you can see it too is short.

86
00:06:25.822 --> 00:06:28.250
It has only, you know, 5 octaves.

87
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.080
And as mentioned before, it's light.

88
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.850
It weighs only exactly 187 pounds,

89
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:37.110
because it lacked,
among other things, a metal frame.

90
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.780
The strings are thin, so
they tend to break rather easily.

91
00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:46.410
Now, here you see, Joseph Haydn,
seated at a keyboard and composing.

92
00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:51.060
Haydn's favorite piano,
is made by Johann Kurnica in Vienna.

93
00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.450
Kurnica's store,
was in the center of Vienna.

94
00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:56.810
You can see it here at the red arrow.

95
00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:01.850
Just down the street from where Mozart
premiered many of his piano concertos.

96
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.790
You can see that at the blue arrow.

97
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:05.410
So Mozart, Heiden, and

98
00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:09.430
Beethoven, would have all played
the kind of piano you see here.

99
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:17.310
Notice that on these late 18th Century
pianos, that there were no pedals.

100
00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:21.980
Now, today, pedals are used to raise or
lower the felt dampers.

101
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:28.170
Raising the dampers, of course,
allows the sound to continue to sound.

102
00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:31.030
Lowering the dampers,
extinguishes the sound.

103
00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:38.290
On these late 18th century pianos,
a knee lever mechanism does the job.

104
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:41.080
And you can see it here,
at the blue arrow.

105
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:46.810
Eventually, in the 19th century as we'll
see, pedals were put on or near the floor.

106
00:07:49.802 --> 00:07:54.940
All right, that's our quick review
of the piano up to early Beethoven.

107
00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.310
Beethoven arrived in Vienna in 1792, and

108
00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:02.180
the piano that you see here
was made in Vienna in 1795.

109
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:07.790
So let's see,
this very piano in the extraordinary

110
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:11.110
Yale Collection of Musical Instruments and
let's meet our guest.

111
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:14.010
The distinguished pianist, Robert Blocker.
