2
00:00:31.894 --> 00:00:35.740
So let me say a word about Robert Blocker,
if I may.

3
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.490
Robert Blocker is
a distinguished music educator.

4
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.590
More than any Dean of the School of
Music that I have experienced in

5
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.860
my long time here at Yale, he has been,
by far and away, the most distinguished

6
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.970
in the sense of artistic accomplishment,
and particularly financial accomplishment.

7
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.830
It is now possible,
owing in large measure to his good labors,

8
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.230
that any student admitted to
the Yale School of Music can come here and

9
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.970
get a free education in music.

10
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.870
Great for Yale, great for
young people, great for music.

11
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.570
But really impresses me about
Robert Block is the following.

12
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.650
In addition to being a distinguished music
educator he also a world renown concert

13
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.070
pianist, and that's really difficult
to do, to have two careers like this.

14
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.370
So I'd like to ask Robert, and

15
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.825
I don't know the answer to this, Robert
what time did you get up this morning?

16
00:01:25.825 --> 00:01:30.220
>> [LAUGH] Very early, but
I normally get up very early.

17
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.910
Well, I know that from the time
I got emails from you.

18
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.270
I get them at, say, 5:10 in the morning.

19
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.100
>> That's about right.

20
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.678
>> He is already up and rolling, and
Robert how are you feeling today,

21
00:01:40.678 --> 00:01:41.380
you feeling tired?

22
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.540
Have you been anywhere interest of late?

23
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.540
>> Well, as you know I'm just
getting back from China.

24
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.580
So, well, I'm acclimating rather well.

25
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.340
>> You were performing in China.

26
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.040
>> I was.

27
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.240
>> Where in China?

28
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.700
>> I was in Shenzhen.

29
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.310
>> I think what we'd like to do now is see

30
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.060
if Robert would like to comment on
the difficulty of playing this.

31
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.590
It might sound easy, oh gee, just go
play a Mozart on this little piano.

32
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.890
How hard can that be?

33
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.010
Oddly, this morning this may be
Robert's most difficult challenge.

34
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.770
So we're starting off
with a tough one here.

35
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.050
And what do you feel when
you go to this piano?

36
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.220
>> It is the most difficult transition for
me.

37
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.410
And I think this piano and

38
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.070
the others that we'll talk about in here,
hold special gifts for

39
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.730
us, gifts of knowledge and
wisdom about the music itself.

40
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.180
About the times that
the music was composed.

41
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.850
And certainly about how
we think about sound,

42
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.040
in terms of the historical nature
of the piece we are playing, and

43
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.810
I'm thinking particularly
now of Beethoven.

44
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.360
>> Hm.
>> Because normally when we attend or

45
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.720
listen to a Beethoven concerto we're in a
large hall with a concert grand Steinway,

46
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.720
a big piano,
an orchestra of 40 to 60 people.

47
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.690
And to think that this
was the instrument for

48
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.790
these concerti at that time is
a remarkable kind of beginning point.

49
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.640
And then the evolution.

50
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.790
So these pianos are instructive for us.

51
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.780
They hold special gifts.

52
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.860
It's remarkable, for me at least,
when I sit down and touch the keys.

53
00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.990
And I just stop for a moment and

54
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:35.510
think, who has heard music
come from this instrument?

55
00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.830
Where did this instrument reside?

56
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.580
What kind of life has it had?

57
00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.785
And each instrument really
takes on its own life.

58
00:03:43.785 --> 00:03:44.760
>> Mm-hm.

59
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.710
>> And
I think that's a kind of remarkable,

60
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.820
emotional piece to put
with the music itself.

61
00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.880
But maybe we should hear a few notes.

62
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.400
And I wanted to mention also
about the pedaling on this piano.

63
00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.900
>> Yes.

64
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.870
>> The pedals are our levers
underneath the keyboard, and

65
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.340
that's one of the biggest adjustments.

66
00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:13.000
And, depending on the physical
frame of the pianist,

67
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.160
that can cause different
kinds of problems.

68
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:21.190
I mean, I found myself yesterday lifting
the piano a little bit off the floor.

69
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.350
And the other thing that
the piano does is it allows for

70
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.220
a lot of sensitivity and finger weight.

71
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:36.540
So those are transitional
issues that any pianist has.

72
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.880
I think it is precisely why
in recent years so many

73
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.020
artists really devote themselves to the
playing of these historical instruments.

74
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.760
So this is my disclaimer,
I am not one of these

75
00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.200
historical artists who would have
far more familiarity with it.

76
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.619
On the other hand though,
I think that for the modern pianist

77
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:07.520
not to have this instructive wisdom
when it's right here as a resource,

78
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.100
would be a huge lapse of judgment
on my part, for me personally.

79
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.480
So, let's hear just a few notes.

80
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.554
I'm going to play, first of all,

81
00:05:19.554 --> 00:05:24.435
the second movement of a Mozart sonata,
K332, and

82
00:05:24.435 --> 00:05:29.965
it will give you an idea of
the intimate quality of this piano.

83
00:05:29.965 --> 00:05:39.965
[MUSIC]

84
00:06:28.384 --> 00:06:31.142
>> Now Dean Blocker turns
from Mozart to Beethoven,

85
00:06:31.142 --> 00:06:35.120
to compare the sound of the opening
of two concertos by Beethoven.

86
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.912
The first concerto, Opus 15,

87
00:06:37.912 --> 00:06:42.906
1797, and the third,
six years later, of 1803.

88
00:06:42.906 --> 00:06:50.740
The point being, how much more
dramatic the latter concerto sounds.

89
00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:55.342
>> So beginning, of course,
with piano solo in C major would be this.

90
00:06:55.342 --> 00:07:05.342
[MUSIC]

91
00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:20.150
So there you have one idea about how this
would open up in this earlier concerto.

92
00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.936
The third, is more expansive,
and a bigger piece.

93
00:07:24.936 --> 00:07:34.936
[MUSIC]

94
00:07:45.751 --> 00:07:50.650
So there you see quite a difference in
the way this piano is going to be used.

95
00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:53.909
>> You almost hear Beethoven crying out,
give me a bigger instrument, please!

96
00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:56.490
It is so dramatic, and so intense.

97
00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:58.785
>> And, he's saying, Robert,
please get the right notes.

98
00:07:58.785 --> 00:08:03.330
[LAUGH]
>> Before we leave the early Beethoven

99
00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.100
type piano,
let's take a close look at that

100
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:10.750
knee lever mechanism that Robert Walker
was using to lift the dampers and

101
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:15.150
allow the strings to continue to sound and
the piano to sing more.

102
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:21.537
And notice that on this keyboard
you'll see the typical black on white

103
00:08:21.537 --> 00:08:24.030
scheme of today reversed.

104
00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:29.520
In this period, you were just as likely
to see white on black as black on white.

105
00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:34.610
But within a decade, black keys
above white keys became the norm.

106
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:40.070
All right, now Dean Blocker will play with
the dampers up and then with them down.

107
00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:46.270
>> Possibly the camera can see,
it's a very slight lift here.

108
00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:48.814
And this is the difference
in sound though,

109
00:08:48.814 --> 00:08:51.026
first without it you would hear this.

110
00:08:51.026 --> 00:08:54.783
[MUSIC]

111
00:08:54.783 --> 00:08:58.556
And that's just with finger legato,
but with this you have.

112
00:08:58.556 --> 00:09:05.462
[MUSIC]

113
00:09:05.462 --> 00:09:08.800
It's a way of sustaining the sound
just a little bit longer.

114
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:14.750
>> Okay, let's slide around the room,
to a larger piano of Beethoven's day.

115
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:18.300
While not owned by Beethoven, but
a make that he would have played.

116
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.600
It was made by the BÃ¶sendorfer
company in Vienna,

117
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.410
a company which very much
still exists today in Vienna.

118
00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.730
This BÃ¶sendorfer was fabricated in 1830 so

119
00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:36.780
it's an historically correct instrument
for playing late Beethoven and Schubert.

120
00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:41.780
You'll see the greater mass here,
it weighs almost three times as

121
00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:46.300
much as our earlier KÃ¶nige piano of 1795.

122
00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:51.300
It has a few more keys and as you'll
hear it has a much bigger sound as

123
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:55.720
Robert Blocker explains, as he introduces
us to this BÃ¶sendorfer instrument.

124
00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:01.650
>> It's bigger in mass and
the keyboard is longer.

125
00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:06.395
There's more pitch range there,

126
00:10:06.395 --> 00:10:10.640
and also the key structure is longer.

127
00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.290
Depending on the shape of your hands,

128
00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:15.440
very difficult to play
an instrument like this, I think.

129
00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:20.980
Here it gets a little bit easier, with
keys, you can move around a little bit.

130
00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:24.190
This was an instrument that
is particularly conducive

131
00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:25.990
of the music of Schubert.

132
00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:27.420
And I'm gonna play a little bit of that.

133
00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:31.050
But before I do,
if you could travel back a few minutes ago

134
00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:35.250
to these Beethoven concerti
where I just played the opening.

135
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:41.420
Hear the difference in this piano, which
is designed for what was happening then.

136
00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:44.480
More public concerts in larger spaces.

137
00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:54.480
[MUSIC]

138
00:10:56.831 --> 00:10:58.421
And then the third.

139
00:10:58.421 --> 00:11:08.421
[MUSIC]

140
00:11:16.326 --> 00:11:21.030
So you have a much larger dynamic
range in this instrument.

141
00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:27.480
The music of Schubert is running
alongside the music of Beethoven here,

142
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:32.710
and this sonata was written very early

143
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:38.000
in his sonata works, but
not published until after his death.

144
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.142
And again here you'll hear the range of
dynamics on this particular instrument.

145
00:11:43.142 --> 00:11:53.142
[MUSIC]

146
00:12:49.941 --> 00:12:54.006
Unfortunately, we have to fade
it out here for reasons of time.

147
00:12:54.006 --> 00:12:58.456
But the obvious point here is that
although the pianoforte was invented in

148
00:12:58.456 --> 00:13:02.547
the 1700's, it's not until 1830,
130 years later,

149
00:13:02.547 --> 00:13:08.290
that the piano begins to sound something
like the grand piano that we know today.

150
00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:12.543
But now,
progress really accelerates rapidly.
