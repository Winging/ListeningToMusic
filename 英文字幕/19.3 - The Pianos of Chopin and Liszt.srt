[MUSIC]

2
00:00:10.087 --> 00:00:14.895
As we continue to move around the room of
the Yale Collection of Musical Instruments

3
00:00:14.895 --> 00:00:17.229
we come to a piano made in Chopin's day,

4
00:00:17.229 --> 00:00:21.370
in Paris in 1842 when the composer,
was at the height of his power.

5
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.220
As you can see by that blue arrow,
it's a kind of piano preferred by Chopin,

6
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.120
a Pleyel piano, but, let's look inside.

7
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.270
Let's look inside at the case here.

8
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.850
And what do we see?

9
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.170
Well, let me see if I can
get my pointer working here.

10
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.690
We see the first signs of
cast iron reinforcement.

11
00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.950
See that bar there,
running up in this direction?

12
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.170
Here's another one here.

13
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.780
And you can see faintly this strip
outside around the sounding board,

14
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.490
comes all the way down here.

15
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.310
Down here, across here and
these are anchored.

16
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.980
These are anchored.

17
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.490
These are tied across in this fashion.

18
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.370
Well, cast iron reinforcing for
a piano was invented in America.

19
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.159
In the city of Boston,
in the late 1830s and

20
00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.730
the idea was quickly
carried back to Europe.

21
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.890
The point of this was the following,
the strings of the grand piano

22
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.160
are anchored at the far
end in the sounding board.

23
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.980
If you put too much tension on
the sounding board, it can implode.

24
00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.440
With metal reinforcement you can put
more strings on the instrument and

25
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.700
really tighten them and
the sound board won't collapse.

26
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.410
Thicker, tighter strings produced
a bigger sound as Robert Blocker

27
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.870
demonstrates with a prelude, a short
freestanding composition by Chopin.

28
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.603
>> I'm going to use two very
different Chopin preludes.

29
00:01:47.603 --> 00:01:52.314
The first in C minor,
which is fortissimo, a huge sound, and

30
00:01:52.314 --> 00:01:55.670
you'll see how this
piano supports that and

31
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.131
then a more intimate
sound in the latter one.

32
00:01:59.131 --> 00:02:09.131
[MUSIC]

33
00:03:36.914 --> 00:03:41.409
And even though there
are pianissimo sounds in there,

34
00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:45.121
there's a different
tamber in the A major and

35
00:03:45.121 --> 00:03:50.902
just maybe the opening phrase of
this prelude will demonstrate that.

36
00:03:50.902 --> 00:04:00.902
[MUSIC]

37
00:04:11.172 --> 00:04:16.230
Its harder to negotiate in some
ways with a very, very light sound.

38
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.500
>> Moving again, we leave the favored
piano of Chopin, the Pleyel and go over to

39
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.160
that of Franz Liszt, an Erard piano,
manufactured again in Paris in 1881.

40
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:33.050
A couple points to notice here, first, the
Koennicke piano on the left has no pedals,

41
00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.100
as we saw before but
rather these knee levers.

42
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.440
This early piano, and this is the second
point, this early piano could make

43
00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:48.930
a very soft sound by bringing strips
of felt up against the strings.

44
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.490
You can see the bright white strips
underneath at the blue arrow there.

45
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.810
They can be pushed up to quiet the sound.

46
00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.910
Up above, at the red arrow, are the
dampers that stop the sound completely.

47
00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.790
Now, with a piano from the 1820s onward,
the device for lifting these dampers

48
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:15.340
off the strings was a pedal,
now placed just above the floor.

49
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.360
The same was true for the soft pedal.

50
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.850
Well, how did the soft pedal work?

51
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.580
Well, by the time of this Pleyel and
the Erard, there were at least two and

52
00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.060
sometimes three strings for
each key on the keyboard.

53
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:36.320
And the pedal on the left would slide the
hammers, all the hammers to the right so

54
00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:42.470
that only one string would sound at
a time producing a softer quieter sound.

55
00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.280
So, the right pedal lifts the dampers and
allows the sound to carry.

56
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.640
The left piano creates a softer sound.

57
00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.750
Damper pedal on the right
at the red arrow.

58
00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.830
Soft pedal on the left, at the blue arrow.

59
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.710
Second point,
this Erard piano is a late instrument and

60
00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.610
you can clearly see the cast
iron reinforcing bars.

61
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.540
The sound is big, pretty much that
of the concert grand of today,

62
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.900
which will be obvious as
Robert Blocker plays, again,

63
00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:18.250
the same Chopin Prelude in C minor but
now on this larger Erard.

64
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:19.580
As he plays,

65
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:25.650
watch his right foot as it clearly
moves the damper pedal up and down.

66
00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.940
And notice that just
before the second phrase,

67
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:34.430
he'll bring in his left foot, bring
it forward, to engage the soft pedal.

68
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:39.370
Thereby, helping the composer make
his music, what he wanted it to be.

69
00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.650
He wanted this phrase to be a soft phase.

70
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:46.807
So, he's now going to, literally,

71
00:06:46.807 --> 00:06:50.578
soft pedal this last musical idea.

72
00:06:50.578 --> 00:07:00.578
[MUSIC]

73
00:07:48.814 --> 00:07:53.715
>> The Erard is a slightly
larger piano than the Pleyel.

74
00:07:53.715 --> 00:07:56.970
It's a little bit longer,
it has more wood.

75
00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:03.500
But I think, another intangible in
any historical instrument or for

76
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:07.300
that matter, new instruments,
is how they're cared for.

77
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.350
This piano has had wonderful care.

78
00:08:11.122 --> 00:08:15.990
And one can tell that when you hear it,
as well as when you play it.

79
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:19.420
The Pleyel has had a more
difficult existence and

80
00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.910
in an instrument like that
it's harder to restore.

81
00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:28.239
I think this is an extraordinarily
beautiful instrument, and

82
00:08:28.239 --> 00:08:32.395
just to demonstrate slightly
one other thing for you,

83
00:08:32.395 --> 00:08:36.300
I want to play the opening
of a Schubert impromptu.

84
00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:42.882
And you can literally hear the top
voice just sing on this instrument.

85
00:08:42.882 --> 00:08:52.882
[MUSIC]

86
00:08:56.685 --> 00:08:59.791
So, it has this beautiful
singing quality to it and

87
00:08:59.791 --> 00:09:04.210
hopefully you could hear that earlier
even in the fortissimo sections.

88
00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:07.270
It's truly a remarkable piano.
