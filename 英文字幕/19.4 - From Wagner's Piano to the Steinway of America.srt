[MUSIC]

2
00:00:14.903 --> 00:00:18.032
Well, as we follow Robert Blocker
from piano to piano,

3
00:00:18.032 --> 00:00:22.161
I think you're coming to have an
appreciation of why this Yale collection

4
00:00:22.161 --> 00:00:26.310
is arguably the finest collection of
keyboard instruments in the world.

5
00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:30.925
In the far corner you see
another remarkable piano,

6
00:00:30.925 --> 00:00:35.115
one owned by Richard Wagner at his
home in Tribschen, Switzerland.

7
00:00:35.115 --> 00:00:38.385
And it was on this instrument that
Wagner composed parts of the music

8
00:00:38.385 --> 00:00:41.855
of the Ring Cycle,
parts of Siegfried and Gotterdamerung.

9
00:00:43.155 --> 00:00:44.965
And of course, Wagner's father in law,

10
00:00:44.965 --> 00:00:49.720
Franz Liszt played on this piano
as well when he visited Wagner.

11
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.240
Yet as rich as this instrument is,
when Robert Blocker plays it,

12
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.150
you'll be struck by its clarity.

13
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.890
>> And now here today at Yale we
have not only the opportunity for

14
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.490
our students to play and
to learn from this instrument, but

15
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:09.649
with yet a new technology to
share this with a wider world.

16
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.786
As Craig pointed out earlier,
this piano has a lot of clarity.

17
00:01:14.786 --> 00:01:21.252
And I wanted to use a couple of examples
from the Brahms Intermezzo, Opus 118.

18
00:01:21.252 --> 00:01:25.671
Late pieces in Brahms'
life where he's refined

19
00:01:25.671 --> 00:01:30.198
this orchestra style in
an economy of resources,

20
00:01:30.198 --> 00:01:34.939
and you can hear some of
the contrapuntal things that

21
00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:38.950
I'm going to point out and
what clarity is.

22
00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.441
First of all,
an excerpt from Opus 118 Number 2.

23
00:01:43.441 --> 00:01:53.441
[MUSIC]

24
00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.262
So you can hear the voices very
clearly interacting with each other.

25
00:02:01.262 --> 00:02:04.884
The piano has a lot of
strength from Opus 116.

26
00:02:04.884 --> 00:02:10.305
Again, the B section of the capriccio.

27
00:02:10.305 --> 00:02:20.305
[MUSIC]

28
00:02:38.362 --> 00:02:42.832
So in this piano we better
understand certainly

29
00:02:42.832 --> 00:02:48.440
the dramatic contrasts that
we hear in Wagner's writing.

30
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.560
Because the piano gives him that basis for

31
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.770
thinking about this in
his own imagination.

32
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.678
>> Now we move to an instrument that
is less clear but much richer in sound,

33
00:02:59.678 --> 00:03:05.030
the massive Steinway of
just three years later,

34
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.130
1867, only three years after
the end of the American Civil War.

35
00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.900
The Steinway in the Yale Collection is so

36
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.430
big that it requires a special
corner all to itself.

37
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.490
Notice that it's far bigger
than any instrument we've seen,

38
00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.110
the biggest in the collection.

39
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.320
We've arrived at the nine foot
long concert grand of today.

40
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.764
But the year is only 1867.

41
00:03:28.764 --> 00:03:33.041
It was built, not in Vienna or
in Berlin by Germans, but

42
00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:39.570
by German immigrants coming to America,
in this case one Henrick Steinweg.

43
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.480
Now, Herr Steinweg soon became Mr.

44
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.850
Steinway, who setup a piano manufacturing
company in New York in the 1850s.

45
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.140
And we'll be joined by Nicholas Renouf,
senior curator of the collection

46
00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.670
to introduce us to this
massive new instrument.

47
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.420
So welcome to America,

48
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:07.220
that burgeoning dynamic new country in
which technology was changing everything.

49
00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.520
We're going to take a look now and
a listen to beautiful large Steinway

50
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.879
piano that has a signficantly different

51
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.550
sound to it than the one we just heard
with the earlier Wagnerian Bechstein.

52
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.210
So we've left Germany, Switzerland,
and now we are only three years later

53
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.640
in the United States with
this new Steinway piano.

54
00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.790
>> This instrument, dating from 1867,
was made at a time when our

55
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:39.330
country was coming of age, not only
industrially, but culturally as well.

56
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.590
Examples such as this, and
instruments by Steinway's rival,

57
00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.220
Chickering, set the European
industry on its ears.

58
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.110
They were appalled that we
had done something that so

59
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.880
impressed the public and
musicians as well.

60
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.963
What we see here is
a complete unitary cast iron

61
00:04:57.963 --> 00:05:02.880
frame that's absolutely rigid in its
resistance of the string tension.

62
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.940
So even greater sonority is
possible with this instrument.

63
00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:14.450
It has the overstrung bass that made
history as well as the cast iron frame.

64
00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.080
And it gives us really the modern piano.

65
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.310
>> It also, I should add,
has a very different action.

66
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.340
And when we speak of the piano action,

67
00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.748
it's the way the keys react
when they're depressed.

68
00:05:29.748 --> 00:05:33.326
And this is a very,
very sensitive action but

69
00:05:33.326 --> 00:05:37.949
certainly not as sensitive as
some of the earlier pianos.

70
00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:40.457
>> [LAUGH]
>> Nothing is as sensitive as that first

71
00:05:40.457 --> 00:05:42.300
Beethoven piano.

72
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.330
But just to give us a good comparison,

73
00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.550
I want to use the same Brahms examples
that we did on the Bechstein.

74
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.399
And you can see, even in this wonderful,
large Steinway piano,

75
00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:58.832
you have a clarity of sound and
even more expansive range, and

76
00:05:58.832 --> 00:06:02.690
especially color because
of the cross-stringing.

77
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:12.690
[MUSIC]

78
00:06:39.138 --> 00:06:42.928
>> To amplify two points
made by Nicholas and Robert,

79
00:06:42.928 --> 00:06:48.218
the massive size of the Steinway is
made possible owing to an innovation

80
00:06:48.218 --> 00:06:53.172
of an American company in Boston,
the Chickering Piano Company.

81
00:06:53.172 --> 00:07:00.920
Now Chickering introduced the uniform or
single piece cast iron frame.

82
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:06.010
Now you can see on the left here,
the German Bechstein of 1864 with

83
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:12.890
the pieces of iron that are attached
to other pieces of iron.

84
00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:21.330
With the Steinway, there is much more
iron surrounding the entire sound board.

85
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.530
it's all one piece, single cast.

86
00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:30.710
And a second point, Robert mentioned
the over stringing of the Steinway.

87
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:34.340
You can see with the Bechstein on
the left that the bass strings

88
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:38.300
run out in a straight line
with the other strings.

89
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:42.710
To the right you see that
the Steinway company decided to

90
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:48.020
take those bass strings and
run them up and over the middle strings.

91
00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:51.920
The earlier Bechstein
did have an advantage.

92
00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.270
Parallel stringing did
produce a very clear sound.

93
00:07:55.270 --> 00:08:01.172
The Steinway, with its overstringing,
creates a richer, more homogenous sound.

94
00:08:01.172 --> 00:08:06.153
And after Steinway really all
grand pianos were made with this

95
00:08:06.153 --> 00:08:08.460
overstringing technique.

96
00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:12.946
But as we can see,
the overstringing is more readily apparent

97
00:08:12.946 --> 00:08:17.550
here on this overhead photo
of a modern Steinway.

98
00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:21.130
The middle strings run straight out.

99
00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:23.320
Follow the red arrow there straight out.

100
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:29.440
While the low bass strings ride up and
over, as indicated by the blue arrow.

101
00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:34.650
Let's go back to the collection now for
a final thanks to our two guests.

102
00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:39.420
So that concludes our brief
tour of this extraordinary

103
00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:41.140
collection of keyboard instruments.

104
00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:45.060
Again, arguably the finest collection
of keyboard instruments in the world.

105
00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:48.470
My thanks to Robert Blocker,
Dean of the Yale School of Music,

106
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:52.830
Senior Curator Nicholas Renouf of
the collection of musical instruments.

107
00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:56.566
This collection, this splendid
collection is open to the public.

108
00:08:56.566 --> 00:09:00.130
So if you're ever in New Haven
please come join me and

109
00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:03.705
join our colleagues at
the collection here at Yale.

110
00:09:03.705 --> 00:09:06.329
Thanks very much.

111
00:09:06.329 --> 00:09:10.881
And the final takeaway from our visit
to the Yale collection of musical

112
00:09:10.881 --> 00:09:15.509
instruments, in the first 100 years
of the existence of the piano,

113
00:09:15.509 --> 00:09:21.470
from its invention in 1700 to the piano of
around 1800, not all that much changed.

114
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:28.720
But during the next 60 years or so,
up to the Steinway of 1867 that we saw,

115
00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:33.700
the piano changed enormously,
going from an almost tiny toy with limited

116
00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:39.620
sound to a monster of various colors and
huge sound.

117
00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:45.414
Notice of course that all this happened
during what period in Western history?

118
00:09:47.854 --> 00:09:53.402
Well, the Industrial Revolution
in Europe and America.

119
00:09:53.402 --> 00:09:59.718
For the piano, the great age of change
was the 60 years between 1800 and 1860.

120
00:09:59.718 --> 00:10:04.820
And not much has changed on
the concert grand since then.

121
00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:07.640
The Industrial Revolution
with the piano and

122
00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:12.850
with other musical instruments,
as we'll see, was the first great era

123
00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:17.650
of technological change in
Western musical history.

124
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:23.030
The second great change of
technological advance came

125
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:27.350
during the 20th century with
the popularization of recorded music.

126
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:32.090
And then especially with a capacity to
digitalize recorded sound to the point

127
00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:38.230
that the entire world of music can
now be contained in a phone and

128
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:39.600
held in your hand.

129
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:42.973
Now that's real change.
