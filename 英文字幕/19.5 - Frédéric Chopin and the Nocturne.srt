[MUSIC]

2
00:00:08.182 --> 00:00:12.143
Here we see on the screen
a portrait of Frederic Chopin,

3
00:00:12.143 --> 00:00:15.948
as painted by his very good
friend Eugène Delacroix.

4
00:00:15.948 --> 00:00:20.504
In his day, Chopin was called the poet of
the piano, and he wrote exclusively for

5
00:00:20.504 --> 00:00:21.900
the piano.

6
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.000
No purely instrumental works,
other than those for the piano, or

7
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.741
that involve the piano one way or
another as a accompanied instrument.

8
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.510
Chopin was Polish by birth, but
his father was french, a french citizen.

9
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.470
And Chopin himself spent almost
all of his adult life in Paris.

10
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.206
In the end living comfortably
in an apartment on the trendy

11
00:00:45.206 --> 00:00:50.244
Place Vendôme across from where
the Ritz Hotel stands today.

12
00:00:50.244 --> 00:00:55.049
And in this apartment,
Chopin died in 1849 at the age of just 39.

13
00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:59.980
Chopin was slight of frame and
weak of constitution.

14
00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.320
He actually died of tuberculosis.

15
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.958
And unlike his friend Franz Liszt,
Chopin much preferred

16
00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:11.311
the quiet calm of the exclusive
salon of the well to do,

17
00:01:11.311 --> 00:01:16.200
to the, Rather large public concert hall.

18
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.850
Chopin's favored instrument was
a Pleyel piano, as we've seen.

19
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.480
Made by the firm of Camille Pleyel.

20
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.950
This one constructed in 1842.

21
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:33.730
To the right, you see an actual photograph
of Chopin, taken in his last year, 1849.

22
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.200
A sickly figure.

23
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.770
As to what Chopin wrote for,
and played on the piano,

24
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.430
well, Nocturnes, Etudes, Preludes.

25
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.540
We heard Robert Blocker play,
Chopin's Prelude in C minor.

26
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.000
Music with a Polish national or
nationalistic flavor, Mazurkas and

27
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.980
Polonaises, and
two lovely piano concertos.

28
00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:03.490
Our aim with Chopin, will be to focus on
the Nocturne genre that he made famous.

29
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.520
What's a Nocturne?

30
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.230
Well as the name suggests it's a night
piece, but a dreamy night piece.

31
00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:13.080
No nightmares here, only blissful,
perhaps romantic sleeps.

32
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.010
Invariably we hear a gentle
rocking accompaniment in the bass,

33
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.730
that's often spun out as an arpeggio.

34
00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.540
And a beautiful melody comes in above.

35
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.990
As we listen to the lovely Nocturne in
Db Major, notice that this style of music

36
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:35.950
is almost identical to that which we
will hear later with Bel canto opera.

37
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:42.950
Indeed the arpeggios below simply recreate
the big guitar effect, as we'll call it.

38
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.270
The big guitar effect,
as we will hear in our next session.

39
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:54.545
When he arrived in Paris in 1830, Chopin
heard much Bel canto opera by Bellini and

40
00:02:54.545 --> 00:03:00.124
Donizetti, and that idiom obviously
seeped deep into his musical psyche,

41
00:03:00.124 --> 00:03:02.670
into his musical consciousness.

42
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:12.670
[MUSIC]

43
00:03:37.051 --> 00:03:38.106
Lovely.

44
00:03:38.106 --> 00:03:41.043
Let's move on to hear parts
of a more famous Nocturne.

45
00:03:41.043 --> 00:03:43.535
One in E Flat Major.

46
00:03:43.535 --> 00:03:44.965
You've likely heard it before.

47
00:03:44.965 --> 00:03:49.471
It was dedicated to,
as you can see here, to Camille Pleyel,

48
00:03:49.471 --> 00:03:52.430
the piano maker, piano manufacturer.

49
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.252
Here we have melody and
chordal accompanied now,

50
00:03:56.252 --> 00:04:01.166
moving with the accompanied here,
moving constantly in a low,

51
00:04:01.166 --> 00:04:05.807
let me see if I can get my cursor
working here, low, middle,

52
00:04:05.807 --> 00:04:10.449
high, low, middle, high,
low, middle, high fashion.

53
00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:14.350
And then up above, of course,
here is the melody.

54
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:15.534
Let's listen to it.

55
00:04:15.534 --> 00:04:25.534
[MUSIC]

56
00:04:44.531 --> 00:04:48.622
Now in his Nocturne,
we hear this songful melody four times,

57
00:04:48.622 --> 00:04:51.980
each subsequent time in
a more elaborate form.

58
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:57.490
Chopin is obviously working through
here theme and variation form.

59
00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.304
Let's hear one of these
ornamented variations,

60
00:05:01.304 --> 00:05:04.219
as indicated within the blue braces.

61
00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:14.219
[MUSIC]

62
00:05:28.807 --> 00:05:30.083
Finally the end.

63
00:05:30.083 --> 00:05:35.911
And again, the sound of Bel canto singing
comes to mind as we listen to the soprano

64
00:05:35.911 --> 00:05:41.137
line work up to a peak, and then hold
as the music stops on a half cadence,

65
00:05:41.137 --> 00:05:45.830
or a pause cadence,
a pause chord on the dominant.

66
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.059
And then we enjoy a solo
vocal like cadenza,

67
00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:55.675
before a final simple iteration
of the tonic major triad.

68
00:05:55.675 --> 00:06:05.675
