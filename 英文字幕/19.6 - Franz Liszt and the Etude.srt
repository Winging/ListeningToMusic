[MUSIC]

2
00:00:12.684 --> 00:00:14.124
Here's an interesting image.

3
00:00:14.124 --> 00:00:18.025
It's a painting done in 1840,
by Josef Danhauser.

4
00:00:18.025 --> 00:00:22.570
In it we see all the artistic
luminaries of the 19th century.

5
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.680
A portrait of Lord George Byron
was on the wall.

6
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.330
Well, he was dead by 1840.

7
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.610
That's why you have a painting of Byron.

8
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:32.840
Here he is, up here.

9
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.070
And then, arm in arm,

10
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.650
the composer, Rossini, next to
the violin virtuoso, Niccolo Pioneer.

11
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.500
Standing over here the great French
poet of the 19th Century, Victor Hugo.

12
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.020
Seated here,
we have Alexander Du Mot Pair,

13
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.800
author of the novel The Count of
Monte Cristo and The Three Musketeers.

14
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.200
Over to his left is Chopin's paramour,
Aurore Dudevant.

15
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.300
Who worked under the name of George Sand,

16
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:10.390
George Sand, the author of numerous,
highly successful, popular novels.

17
00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.140
She, of course, had to take a nom de
plume because it was difficult for

18
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.000
any woman to get any attention as
an artist in the 19th century.

19
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.220
Always smoking cigars, as was her want.

20
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.730
Down here in supine position,

21
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.010
we have Marie Dagul, author of seven
important books on French history.

22
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.190
She, too, had to write under a nom de
plume, Daniel Stern, in that case.

23
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.830
Up here, on top of the piano,
an overly large bust of

24
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.590
Beethoven who looks down on
the assembly from Olympian heights.

25
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.800
Beethoven was the artistic figure
who dominated in the 19th century.

26
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.990
All of these great artists look
reverentially, in silence, upon Beethoven,

27
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:57.290
and none less so than Franz Liszt,
seated at the piano, the greatest pianist,

28
00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:03.160
pianist, of the day, and look at
the enormous size of his hands here.

29
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.700
So there they all were.

30
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.610
Well, actually they all weren't.

31
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.220
These individuals never came together for
this portrait.

32
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.730
They were just painted
in from other images.

33
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.230
In modern parlance,
this whole things was Photoshopped.

34
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.710
What was it, then?

35
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:28.250
Well, it was a marketing ploy,
effected by a piano manufacturer,

36
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.720
one of the many then working in Vienna,
one Conrad Graf.

37
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.640
The painting, as we said, was a marketing
tool of the sort that we have today.

38
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.300
If Derek Jeter or Roger Federer wear
a Movado watch, you should, too.

39
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.890
If Franz Liszt plays a Graf piano,
you should, too.

40
00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.330
So, go out and buy one.

41
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.880
Enjoy it.

42
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:57.680
Choosing Liszt as the poster boy for
the piano was clever salesmanship, for no

43
00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.750
one was better known as a virtuoso pianist
in the 19th century than Franz Liszt.

44
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.530
He was a towering figure.

45
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.950
He had movie star good looks, and
he always liked to be painted showing

46
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.690
the right side of his face because he
had a large mole on the left side.

47
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.870
And he was the rock star
of the nineteenth century.

48
00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.350
Three thousand, mostly women,
would crowd into the newly enlarged

49
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.280
concert hall to hear him
play all across Europe.

50
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.050
We once had Beatlemania in the 1960s, but
the use of the term artist's name plus

51
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:37.057
mania was first coined back
in the 1840s by the German

52
00:03:37.057 --> 00:03:42.320
poet and reclaimed it for Liszt.

53
00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.330
Lisztomania it was called.

54
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.960
Women fought for a lock of his hair.

55
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.700
For a torn away part of his velvet gloves.

56
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.150
They threw flowers at him on the stage.

57
00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.310
Through his public performances,

58
00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.380
Liszt established the piano
recital as we know it today.

59
00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.999
Liszt was the person who actually
coined the term, recital.

60
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.260
It was a poetic recitation in music and
by Liszt alone.

61
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.600
Up to that time a solo artist would have
to share a program with other performers.

62
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.920
You'd think you got cheated if
more than one, only one showed up.

63
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.020
Liszt was also the first
to turn the piano.

64
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.430
At right angles to the stage,

65
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.600
again possible because he
favored his right side.

66
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.330
Anyway, it was quite a show,
and Liszt lived life large.

67
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.970
I could go on and on.

68
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.470
It's really a fascinating life of
a flamboyant figure and a great artist.

69
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.810
And oh, did I mention that later in life,
after many mistresses on many continents.

70
00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:53.860
Bougival Lizst took holy orders and
lived in the Vatican for a while.

71
00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.150
I'm not making this up.

72
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.675
And styled himself as Abby Liszt.

73
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.900
And here we see Abby Lizst later in
life in saucerdoodle dress playing for

74
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:04.727
a large well-to-do group.

75
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.900
Maybe with an emperor and
his son in the front row, I can't be sure.

76
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.970
But what I can be sure of is
that the piano he was playing is

77
00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.550
a Viennese Bösendorfer because the name
is right there above the keyboard.

78
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:24.270
We saw a Bösendorfer in the Yale
collection earlier on in this session.

79
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.780
And again, the adoring crowr,
crowd here has thrown flowers at his feet.

80
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.720
But if Liszt had a choice, especially
when he was in France or England,

81
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.970
he preferred and Erard piano of
the sort that we have seen before.

82
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:44.250
And here's an instrument with a history.

83
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.920
Remember, we said that,
earlier on in our session,

84
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.150
we said that the two most
innovative companies or

85
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.670
piano manufacturing at this time
were not in Europe but in America.

86
00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.480
One was Steinway in New York.

87
00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.690
The other is Chickering in Boston.

88
00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.380
And just as manufacturer
Conrad Graf did a bit

89
00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.300
of celebrity marketing with Liszt, so
too did the American firm Chickering.

90
00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.280
Chickering shipped this
gigantic grand piano,

91
00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.390
concert grand nine feet long as
you can see there, all the way

92
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:25.910
to the Vatican where Liszt was living for
a while in the 1860s.

93
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:30.440
And then over the Alps to Hungary,
to Liszt's home in Budapest.

94
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.180
And here's where it rests today, in Pest.

95
00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:36.700
A massive state of the art.

96
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.440
And grand piano in every way.

97
00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.100
Well, what did Liszt write for the piano.

98
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:49.170
Well, he wrote Hungarian Rhapsodies and
transcriptions for

99
00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:53.090
the piano, such as we saw with
regard to Schubert's Erlking,

100
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:57.370
Liszt transcribed this into
a piano-only arrangement.

101
00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:04.040
And we have the studies,
the transcendatal transcendental etudes,

102
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.190
and the concert etudes.

103
00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.740
So, what's an etude?

104
00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:08.846
That's a study.

105
00:07:08.846 --> 00:07:14.528
Etude is a piece with the aim to
improve someone's technique through

106
00:07:14.528 --> 00:07:19.570
practice the particular aspect
of performance to teach, well,

107
00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:24.440
maybe how to play a chromatic scale very,
very rapidly.

108
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:29.110
Or to keep your hands
together while leaping up and

109
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:31.960
down in octaves and not miss any notes.

110
00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.030
Or play an arpeggio with just
the left hand alone whatever.

111
00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:41.191
Maybe your mother made you practice
etudes or studies of Clementi or

112
00:07:41.191 --> 00:07:45.410
perhaps Cramer when you were
a fledgeling young pianist.

113
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:46.860
As a youngster.

114
00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:50.432
Well, there's an irony
here with Lizst etudes.

115
00:07:50.432 --> 00:07:55.100
They're so difficult that you
have to already be a virtuoso to

116
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:59.512
play the etudes that would
allow you to become a virtuoso.

117
00:07:59.512 --> 00:08:03.824
Lizst etudes are really no help
at all to those wishing to

118
00:08:03.824 --> 00:08:06.830
learn how to play the piano.

119
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:09.794
Only a dozen or so
people on the planet Earth,

120
00:08:09.794 --> 00:08:15.426
as Robert Schumann famously commented,
could actually play these etudes by Liszt.

121
00:08:15.426 --> 00:08:19.740
They were of transcendent,
transcendental difficulty.

122
00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:26.004
Let's give a listen to just one of
the transcendental etudes by Liszt.

123
00:08:26.004 --> 00:08:28.674
One entitled Wild Hunt.

124
00:08:28.674 --> 00:08:30.407
Don't try this at home kids.

125
00:08:30.407 --> 00:08:40.407
[MUSIC]

126
00:09:10.948 --> 00:09:16.548
Now, of course, almost every
successful public figure is likely

127
00:09:16.548 --> 00:09:22.150
to be the object of cartoons and
caricature at one time or another.

128
00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:24.970
And Liszt was no exception.

129
00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:28.354
Piano player, as we see here,
or was he piano slayer?

130
00:09:28.354 --> 00:09:34.967
But one thing that such images
seem to have in common is this,

131
00:09:34.967 --> 00:09:40.810
that Liszt appeared to have
more than just two hands.

132
00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:43.290
And critics referred to
his three-hand trick.

133
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:45.870
He could keep a bass and soprano going,

134
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:49.780
but somehow fill the melody in in
the middle with another, third, hand.

135
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:54.280
Now, while all this might seem like just
pure showmanship, technical razzle dazzle

136
00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:58.830
of the most superficial sort,
don't sell Liszt short here.

137
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:04.668
Sometimes, there is
extraordinary artistry,

138
00:10:04.668 --> 00:10:10.440
far-seeing artistry, in his music.

139
00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.900
I want to end this session with a bit of
Liszt's etude, called Un Sospiro, a sigh.

140
00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:19.432
And it does have, in the midst
of all the technical virtuosity,

141
00:10:19.432 --> 00:10:23.333
the loveliest, sort of sigh-like melody.

142
00:10:23.333 --> 00:10:27.443
But it's the end that
impresses me the most.

143
00:10:27.443 --> 00:10:32.922
There are some bizarre chordal
shifts involving a tritone.

144
00:10:32.922 --> 00:10:36.196
Let me see if I can
play just one of these.

145
00:10:36.196 --> 00:10:46.196
[MUSIC]

146
00:10:48.789 --> 00:10:51.761
That's a strange relationship.

147
00:10:51.761 --> 00:10:56.452
And this Etude concludes with a core
progression of the sort that no

148
00:10:56.452 --> 00:10:58.900
one else was writing it this time.

149
00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:05.169
The kind of rich harmonic sound that will
only become commonplace 50 years later.

150
00:11:05.169 --> 00:11:10.301
Liszt was not only a showman,
he was a visionary.

00:12:18.075 --> 00:12:19.870
