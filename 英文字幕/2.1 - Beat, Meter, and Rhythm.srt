[MUSIC]

2
00:00:29.635 --> 00:00:33.103
That was music from George Gershwin's
1930 musical Crazy Girl and

3
00:00:33.103 --> 00:00:34.440
the song I've Got Rhythm.

4
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.015
Well we've all got rhythm.

5
00:00:39.015 --> 00:00:41.860
Rhythm, along with melody,
harmony, tone, color, texture and

6
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.260
form, are the essential elements of music.

7
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.530
We'll be exploring these elements
in our next several sessions.

8
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.370
We'll start with rhythm,
because rhythm provides a framework,

9
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.820
a framework in time in which sounds,
pitches, can rest.

10
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.730
We all have rhythm, of our lives,
and a beat, a heart beat.

11
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.700
And, of course,
there's a beat in music too.

12
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.600
Most music has a regular pulse to it.

13
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.590
Some music, Gregorian chant, for
example, doesn't have a beat.

14
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.360
Here's a group of singers I organized some
years ago singing a Gregorian chant at

15
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.482
Yale University,

16
00:01:19.482 --> 00:01:23.843
along with an image of a chant manuscript
from the Yale rare book library.

17
00:01:23.843 --> 00:01:27.505
In this music there really is no beat.

18
00:01:27.505 --> 00:01:37.505
[MUSIC]

19
00:02:01.758 --> 00:02:05.060
Very beautiful, but no beat.

20
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.020
Pop music usually has a very strong beat.

21
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.380
That's one of the things
that makes it popular.

22
00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.740
We respond,
almost primordially, to a beat.

23
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.640
Here's an example of a pop
piece with a strong beat, and

24
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.600
also a strong backbeat that
helps us emphasize the beat.

25
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.376
It's a video created as a somewhat
organized, or maybe disorganized,

26
00:02:28.376 --> 00:02:33.557
flash mob, or flash dance, recently in
the main library of Yale University.

27
00:02:36.216 --> 00:02:40.803
[INAUDIBLE]

28
00:02:40.803 --> 00:02:50.803
[MUSIC]

29
00:03:19.433 --> 00:03:19.976
Pretty good.

30
00:03:19.976 --> 00:03:23.477
It's almost impossible not
to tap your foot to that.

31
00:03:23.477 --> 00:03:28.560
In classical music, there is a beat,
but it's often suppressed.

32
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.770
It's more subdued.

33
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.530
The rock musician, Brian Eno,
who worked with the Beatles,

34
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.235
once said classical music
is music without Africa.

35
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.550
Meaning that music without
a strong rhythmic profile.

36
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.670
And for the most part, he was right.

37
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.640
But here's an example of classical music
in which there is a pretty clear beat,

38
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.690
Pomp and Circumstance March by
the classical composer Edward Elgar.

39
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.299
You've probably heard it at a graduation.

40
00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:08.299
[MUSIC]

41
00:04:23.846 --> 00:04:28.266
Not surprising that in this classical
movement, the beat is pronounced because

42
00:04:28.266 --> 00:04:31.649
we're supposed to march to it
during a graduation ceremony.

43
00:04:31.649 --> 00:04:36.246
I'd say in Pomp and Circumstance,
we have a medium strong beat.

44
00:04:36.246 --> 00:04:41.064
But here's a much better example of what
I mean when I say the classical music

45
00:04:41.064 --> 00:04:42.957
often has a suppressed beat.

46
00:04:42.957 --> 00:04:45.980
Or the sound of the beat is weak.

47
00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.360
Indeed, where is the beat here?

48
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.410
Can you tap your foot to it like
you could with the Macklemore?

49
00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.382
Here's Debussy's Claire de lune.

50
00:04:56.337 --> 00:05:06.337
[MUSIC]

51
00:05:27.051 --> 00:05:30.160
So, we have heard strong beat,
medium beat,

52
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.810
and very weak beat or suppressed beat.

53
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.910
Beats come along in regular intervals and
are of the same duration, regular beat.

54
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:45.840
However, the western psyche doesn't like
streams of undifferentiated anything.

55
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.440
We group time into units of seconds,
minutes, and hours to make sense of it.

56
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.750
We group decades and centuries into
periods and call them the Renaissance and

57
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.350
the Enlightenment, to help us make
sense of what would otherwise be

58
00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.380
a seemingly endless flow of time.

59
00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.340
I'm convinced that in
my Toyota automobile,

60
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.388
the safety belt alarm goes ding-ding-ding,

61
00:06:07.388 --> 00:06:12.710
ding-ding-ding, ding-ding-ding if I
don't have my seat belt fastened.

62
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.730
So too in music, we group the endless
flow of beats to make sense of them.

63
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.760
Here's an undifferentiated flow of beats.

64
00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.400
We can sound them with this gadget.

65
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.065
And we've been doing that
since the time of Beethoven.

66
00:06:26.065 --> 00:06:31.721
[SOUND]
Called of

67
00:06:31.721 --> 00:06:39.556
course a metronome.

68
00:06:39.556 --> 00:06:42.020
And here's what we instinctively do.

69
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.790
We take these beats and
group them into units of two.

70
00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:48.970
So here are the beats.

71
00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:56.008
Now group into units of two, or
we can group them into units of three.

72
00:06:57.266 --> 00:06:58.550
And of four.

73
00:07:02.306 --> 00:07:04.637
But in fact, in most, but not always,

74
00:07:04.637 --> 00:07:08.900
music written in four beats is just
a multiple of music in two beats.

75
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.990
So really, for our course, we are going
to have just two beat music and

76
00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:14.190
three beat music.

77
00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:17.190
Music in duple or music in triple meter.

78
00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.380
Now, I just used the word meter there.

79
00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:27.926
When we group beats into regularly
recurring units, we create meter in music.

80
00:07:27.926 --> 00:07:31.091
Meter is simply a pattern of
regularly recurring beats.

81
00:07:31.091 --> 00:07:36.420
The lines that separate the groups
are called bar lines or measure lines.

82
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:42.130
Each unit constitutes a bar or a measure.

83
00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:46.884
Bar lines tend to make
western music on a grid.

84
00:07:46.884 --> 00:07:50.718
Other cultures don't have
this kind of grid, and

85
00:07:50.718 --> 00:07:54.750
as a result their music is
a good deal more flexible.

86
00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:59.740
But we in the west, we have these
measure lines, or these bar lines, and

87
00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:02.720
it's almost as if you can't
break out from behind the bars.

88
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.670
That you're kept inside of the measure.

89
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:10.930
Okay, so we've talked about beats,
and meters, and measures, or

90
00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:12.990
bars and bar lines.

91
00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:18.185
Now, let's take a look at this same
material in a slightly different way,

92
00:08:18.185 --> 00:08:21.489
but before that,
I've got a question for you.

93
00:08:21.489 --> 00:08:25.377
What are the two axes, or
coordinates, of music?

94
00:08:25.377 --> 00:08:28.489
Again, what are the two axes,
or coordinates of music?

95
00:08:32.041 --> 00:08:33.080
Right.

96
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.680
Pitch and duration.

97
00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.440
Otherwise said, sound and time.

98
00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:43.130
Pitch is represented on a vertical
axis in written form, and

99
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:45.590
time on a horizontal one.

100
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:46.551
Here's a graph to demonstrate this.

101
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:56.750
Now, here's a score of
a piano piece by Beethoven.

102
00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:02.240
This musical score is
just a complex version

103
00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.580
of this previous slide's simple idea.

104
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.830
Pitch is indicated vertically,
time horizontally.

105
00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:14.620
How do we get from this simple
idea of a two axes graph

106
00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:18.970
to this complex version of musical
notation that you see on the screen?

107
00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:21.266
Well, we'll look at that
in our next segment.
