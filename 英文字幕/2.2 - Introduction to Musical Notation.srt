2
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.730
Let's look at some images
of musical notation.

3
00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.210
But we should say at the outset that
Western music is the only musical culture

4
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.830
that uses musical notation
in a controlling way.

5
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.940
Yes, there is Chinese musical notation,
and there is Indian musical notation.

6
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.990
But neither controls the creation and
performance of music

7
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.300
to the extent that notation does in
the Western classical tradition.

8
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.470
So how did Western musical notation begin?

9
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.360
How did we get from this
complex score here?

10
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.490
How did we get to it?

11
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.360
Well, let's look at some slides,
and see how this unfolded.

12
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.040
Western musical notation began when
musicians in monasteries, around the year

13
00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:02.070
900, common era, began to create
a graphic image of their music.

14
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.080
They tried to capture and
freeze sound onto paper,

15
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.820
or in this case onto parchment.

16
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.190
And they did so in this fashion.

17
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.580
Notice all the undulations here.

18
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.670
The musical scribes are trying
to represent the high and

19
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.980
low flow of the music by graphic symbols.

20
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.660
They look like worms, squiggling across
the page, but they're called, these little

21
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:34.680
aggregates are called neumes, neumes that
represented a collection of pitches.

22
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.060
If the voice produced a high pitch,
they wrote a visually higher symbol.

23
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.950
Eventually, these neumes were separated
into individual discrete pitches

24
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.420
called notae, hence our word note,
a symbol for a pitch.

25
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.330
But these notes, originally, were only
indicators of pitch, not duration.

26
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.030
Eventually, as you can see by both
the left and right hand image here,

27
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.190
eventually musicians introduced
the practice of assigning

28
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.220
each note a particular note
shape to indicate its duration.

29
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.560
The note could have tail on it or a flag,
or could be filled in or it could be open.

30
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.100
It could have a dot after it and so on.

31
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.517
It took several hundred years
from roughly 1200 to 1600 for

32
00:02:24.517 --> 00:02:30.940
this system of symbols representing
duration to quite literally take shape.

33
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.460
So now we understand something of
the origins of these notational symbols

34
00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.390
in the West.

35
00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.270
And they are just symbols of something.

36
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.340
They represent something,
pitch and duration.

37
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.190
Let's look at how we use them today.

38
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.720
Originally the beat in music was
carried by this thing, the open circle,

39
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.315
the whole note,
as you see on the left of the screen.

40
00:02:54.315 --> 00:02:58.440
Then as more and more texts was added
to the music over the centuries

41
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.680
the beat fell down to the half
note as the beat carrier.

42
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.630
And today, most music is represented by
the symbol in the middle of the page,

43
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.620
the quarter note as carrying the beat.

44
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.830
The quarter note as beat carrying unit.

45
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.000
Notice here that we have
a duple division in the music.

46
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.100
Whole note is divided into two halves,
half note into two quarters,

47
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.550
quarter note into two eighths, and so on.

48
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.750
There's also a triple division,

49
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.420
which is affected by means of a dot
that adds 50% of the value to the note.

50
00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.320
This makes a half note equal to two,
not three quarter notes.

51
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.440
The dotted quarter equal to three
eighth notes, not just two, and so on.

52
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.210
And this is how we get
triple meter in music.

53
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:51.070
We can see how this works in a patriotic
song, known in the US as My Country

54
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.680
'Tis of Thee, elsewhere as God Save
the King or God Save the Queen.

55
00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.290
On the top, you see the text.

56
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.590
Beneath it,
horizontal dashes to show duration.

57
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.440
Then duration appears in a different way.

58
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.870
In musical symbols.

59
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.660
Then the beat is shown by
quarter notes below it.

60
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.380
Again, the quarter notes
represent the beat in most music.

61
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.500
Finally, we see the position of
the quarter note within each measure.

62
00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.395
But we don't want to make
things too complex here.

63
00:04:21.395 --> 00:04:24.440
This should be a course about emotions and
feelings.

64
00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.020
You don't have to read musical
notation to feel and to have emotions.

65
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.500
You don't have to read musical notation
to get a great deal out of music,

66
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.200
to get a great deal out of this course.

67
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.650
Generally speaking,
here's all you have to know.

68
00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.650
Whenever you see a musical example,
musical notation signs

69
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:50.020
placed higher vertically
represent high sounding pitches.

70
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.280
Lower signs mean lower sounding pitches.

71
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.770
Notation that gets increasingly darker
with more flags on it represents

72
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:04.050
that that music is moving faster up and
down, left to right.

73
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.453
Darker means faster.

74
00:05:05.453 --> 00:05:07.734
I'll play it for you.

75

76
00:05:22.767 --> 00:05:27.986
You can imagine how the reverse of
that operates coming back down.

77
00:05:27.986 --> 00:05:34.774
Voila, that's all you need to
know about musical notation.
