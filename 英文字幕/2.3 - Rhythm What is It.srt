[MUSIC]

2
00:00:10.212 --> 00:00:13.470
Beat and
meter are rather easy to understand.

3
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.710
Oddly rhythm is a bit more complicated.

4
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.260
Rhythm is the organization of time
into compelling patterns of long and

5
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:22.900
short sounds.

6
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.760
Here's a famous melody, one created
by the French composer, Maurice Ravel

7
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.720
from his ballet, Bolero of 1928.

8
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:40.460
There's a tune, a succession of higher and
lower pitches shown vertically.

9
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.210
And there's a rhythm moving left to right.

10
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.750
Now let's strip away pitch and
leave the rhythm alone.

11
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.320
And it will look like this
as we see on our next slide.

12
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.740
But what we hear first at the beginning
of Bolero is not the melody but

13
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:00.890
another rhythm.

14
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:01.390
This one.

15
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.940
And it's played by a snare drum.

16
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.320
Now a snare drum, as you may know,
has no particular pitch.

17
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.586
It just plays a rhythm, pure rhythm.

18
00:01:11.586 --> 00:01:12.421
I'll tap it.

19
00:01:12.421 --> 00:01:22.421
[MUSIC]

20
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.920
And that's all the snare drum player does.

21
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.273
So he better like that pattern,
he's gonna be doing it for the next 14 and

22
00:01:31.273 --> 00:01:32.030
a half minutes.

23
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.625
Now beneath the snare drum pattern,

24
00:01:35.625 --> 00:01:40.462
low strings play another rhythm that
provides something of a harmony.

25
00:01:40.462 --> 00:01:42.379
Let's take a look at that now.

26
00:01:42.379 --> 00:01:43.421
Bum.

27
00:01:43.421 --> 00:01:53.004
[MUSIC]

28
00:01:53.004 --> 00:01:54.296
And so on.

29
00:01:54.296 --> 00:02:00.120
Eventually, the flute enters,
adding the enchanting melody.

30
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.050
So now we have three
rhythms operating here.

31
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.410
One in the flute,
which also carries the melody.

32
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.420
One in the snare drum,
which is a simple, or pure rhythm.

33
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.790
And a third in the bass,

34
00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.200
which is providing something of
a harmony below the melody up above.

35
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.320
So, we have three rhythms
that are staying within and

36
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.380
emphasizing the structure of the measure.

37
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.460
Three different rhythms
sounding simultaneously,

38
00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.310
three different patterns of longs and
shorts.

39
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.640
Let's give a listen to
the South Korean Phil Harmonic Orchestra

40
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.020
as it performs this work.

41
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.951
I like the recording engineering here,

42
00:02:35.951 --> 00:02:39.297
it's very easy to hear
the three musical parts.

43
00:02:39.297 --> 00:02:49.297
[MUSIC]

44
00:03:35.087 --> 00:03:37.230
So who's playing the beat here?

45
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.810
Well, no one is actually playing the beat.

46
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.930
About the only time an instrument
plays the beat in the music is when

47
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.930
the bass drum in a marching
band plays the beat.

48
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.570
Or maybe a drummer in a rock band
playing the bass drum by means

49
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.540
of left foot on a pedal.

50
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.338
So how is it then that we hear the beat?

51
00:03:54.338 --> 00:03:55.379
Well, we hear.

52
00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:05.671
[MUSIC]

53
00:04:05.671 --> 00:04:11.098
Well, our ear, actually our brain,
digest this complex of information and

54
00:04:11.098 --> 00:04:16.740
extrapolates it from it a basic structural
framework underlying the music.

55
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.470
So kinda platonic mental reality

56
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.770
over arching structure that
no one actually hears.

57
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.640
No one actually sees but it's there.

58
00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.390
But we do hear the beat.

59
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.220
And we hear the beats organized
into groups of three.

60
00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:37.325
One two three, one two three, and so on.

61
00:04:37.325 --> 00:04:40.270
Bollero is written in triple meter.

62
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.370
We feel the triple meter, and
that's all that really counts.

63
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.370
But if we want confirmation of this,
we can look at the musical notation,

64
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.540
particularly the base, where we
see clearly three quarter notes or

65
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.170
the equivalent of three
quarter notes in each measure.

66
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.670
Why do we hear?

67
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.260
It is triple meter.

68
00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.754
To see how that works,
let's turn to a class video demonstration.

69
00:05:09.754 --> 00:05:17.879
[MUSIC]

70
00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:19.461
What's the key here?

71
00:05:19.461 --> 00:05:20.629
What do you listen to?

72
00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:22.504
How many think it's in duple meter?

73
00:05:22.504 --> 00:05:23.379
Raise your hand.

74
00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:24.400
How many think it's in triple meter?

75
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.480
Okay, almost everybody thinks it's
a duple meter, and that's correct.

76
00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.990
Now, we worked through this
just a little bit once before,

77
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.950
what is it that tells us
that it's in duple meter?

78
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:35.962
It's the?

79
00:05:35.962 --> 00:05:36.462
>> Bass.

80
00:05:36.462 --> 00:05:37.212
>> Bass.

81
00:05:37.212 --> 00:05:38.754
[MUSIC]

82
00:05:38.754 --> 00:05:43.040
Because it's organizing itself
very strongly in duple patterns.

83
00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.910
There's one other
interesting thing in here.

84
00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.962
This would be, well, let's think
through that in one additional way.

85
00:05:49.962 --> 00:05:53.461
And that is, notice that in duple
meter we have a strong beat.

86
00:05:53.461 --> 00:05:54.046
Right?

87
00:05:54.046 --> 00:05:59.212
Strong, weak, strong, weak, strong,
weak, strong, weak, in that sense.

88
00:05:59.212 --> 00:06:03.921
Or if we have triple, it would be
strong weak, weak, strong, weak, weak.

89
00:06:03.921 --> 00:06:08.921
There would be two weak beats, or two
unstressed beats between each strong beat.

90
00:06:08.921 --> 00:06:10.128
We could do this.

91
00:06:10.128 --> 00:06:20.128
[MUSIC]

92
00:06:22.962 --> 00:06:25.587
And we'd have the waltz of the bulldog.

93
00:06:25.587 --> 00:06:27.046
It'd be pretty cool to see actually.

94
00:06:27.046 --> 00:06:28.113
>> [LAUGH]
>> So there,

95
00:06:28.113 --> 00:06:32.450
I'm simply taking the Cole Porter piece
and throwing in an extra beat in each

96
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:36.879
measure, an unstressed beat in each
measure, and it works out pretty well.

97
00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:41.631
Notice, this would be, Harvard would've
had a field day with this melody if

98
00:06:41.631 --> 00:06:43.837
Cole Porter had not done one thing.

99
00:06:43.837 --> 00:06:49.296
He makes this really rather snappy
by the use of this kind of stuff.

100
00:06:49.296 --> 00:06:51.962
[MUSIC]

101
00:06:51.962 --> 00:06:56.637
We're coming in on bum, bum, bum,
bum, and it's dun, dun, dun, dun,

102
00:06:56.637 --> 00:06:58.710
da-dun, dun, dun, da-dun.

103
00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:59.800
What's that a good example of?

104
00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:02.010
Syncopation.

105
00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:03.290
Yeah, terms on the board up there.

106
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.000
But it's a good example of syncopation.

107
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.750
Sort of jumping in ahead of time, cutting
off the beginning in there ahead of time.

108
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:13.630
And throwing off the metrical balance for
a very short period of time.

109
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:19.546
Okay, let's see now if you can hear the
difference between duple and triple meter.

110
00:07:19.546 --> 00:07:22.587
I'll play two examples.

111
00:07:25.129 --> 00:07:35.129
[MUSIC]

112
00:08:00.504 --> 00:08:04.212
That's number one, here's another one.

113
00:08:04.212 --> 00:08:06.212
Which is duple, which is triple?

114
00:08:06.212 --> 00:08:16.212
[MUSIC]

115
00:08:32.921 --> 00:08:33.628
Right.

116
00:08:33.628 --> 00:08:39.170
The first one was triple,
second one was duple.

117
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:40.504
How'd you do?

118
00:08:40.504 --> 00:08:41.546
Well here's one more.

119
00:08:41.546 --> 00:08:45.212
Let's try another, one last one of these.

120
00:08:45.212 --> 00:08:45.962
You'll like it.

121
00:08:45.962 --> 00:08:49.171
First there was music by Hendel.

122
00:08:49.171 --> 00:08:50.379
That was this piece.

123
00:08:50.379 --> 00:08:54.504
[MUSIC]

124
00:08:54.504 --> 00:08:58.171
That's our triple meter piece and
we had music by Schubert.

125
00:08:58.171 --> 00:08:59.461
This is our duple meter piece.

126
00:08:59.461 --> 00:09:04.421
[MUSIC]

127
00:09:04.421 --> 00:09:06.587
Let's try one other one.

128
00:09:06.587 --> 00:09:07.837
What about this one?

129
00:09:07.837 --> 00:09:17.837
[MUSIC]

130
00:09:41.212 --> 00:09:43.129
And so on.

131
00:09:43.129 --> 00:09:44.921
Right again.

132
00:09:44.921 --> 00:09:46.213
Triple meter.
