2
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.370
At the end of the class video I
was talking about syncopation.

3
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:13.760
What's syncopation?

4
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.780
Well actually the term comes from
a Greek word, syncope, to cut off,

5
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.332
or to to compress.

6
00:00:20.332 --> 00:00:23.360
In music, syncopation works this way.

7
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.770
A composer sets up a beat and
an expectation of a beat.

8
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.320
But then,
throws in a strong pulse off that beat.

9
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.080
Something off the beat.

10
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.328
Here are two examples.

11
00:00:38.328 --> 00:00:42.136
[MUSIC]

12
00:00:42.136 --> 00:00:42.740
Here's our beat.

13
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.409
[MUSIC]

14
00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:53.320
So there is a simple instance of
syncopation, where you see the arrows.

15
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.870
Let's take a look at another example here.

16
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.480
This time from the well know theme song to
the TV or the cartoon show, The Simpsons.

17
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.558
So we could start a beat.

18
00:01:04.558 --> 00:01:14.751
[MUSIC]

19
00:01:14.751 --> 00:01:18.340
Pretty catchy,
maybe that's why that show is so popular.

20
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.740
To drive home the point of
syncopation one more time,

21
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.810
let's watch another class video.

22
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.060
So let's play just a little bit
of The Entertainer very slowly.

23
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.580
My question to you is
where is the syncopation?

24
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.619
Is it in the left hand of the piano or
in the right hand of the piano.

25
00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.639
Is it in the bass or the melody?

26
00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:50.639
[MUSIC]

27
00:02:06.761 --> 00:02:08.247
Where's the syncopation, left hand?

28
00:02:08.247 --> 00:02:09.408
Right hand?

29
00:02:09.408 --> 00:02:10.058
Right hand.

30
00:02:10.058 --> 00:02:11.521
Bass is just going.

31
00:02:11.521 --> 00:02:12.519
Well, what is the bass going?

32
00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:22.519
[MUSIC]

33
00:02:25.034 --> 00:02:25.591
In that fashion.

34
00:02:25.591 --> 00:02:27.356
One, it's playing eighth notes.

35
00:02:27.356 --> 00:02:30.142
One and two and, sub divided into beat.

36
00:02:30.142 --> 00:02:31.094
Where as the syncopation.

37
00:02:31.094 --> 00:02:34.321
[MUSIC]

38
00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:35.105
It's there.

39
00:02:35.105 --> 00:02:38.185
Ya di, di, di, di, di and so on.

40
00:02:38.185 --> 00:02:41.830
So you're tapping your foot,
you're tapping the beat.

41
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.420
And a lot of the music
is coming off the beat.

42
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.700
Let's see if we can do that.

43
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.820
Let's see if we can create our
own syncopated orchestra in here.

44
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.990
We've got an example up here,
this is the conception of it.

45
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.000
Let's see if we can actually execute it.

46
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.590
What I'd like you to do,
everybody tap your foot,

47
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.480
we're gonna do this in fours just for
because I think it works out better.

48
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.750
So everybody tap your
foot with a four beat.

49
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:12.560
Here we go one, two, three, four,
one, two, three, four nice and loud.

50
00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.452
Come on.
I wanna hear it.

51
00:03:13.452 --> 00:03:18.037
[SOUND] Okay, now take your
hand on a chair, your notebook,

52
00:03:18.037 --> 00:03:22.547
your computer, whatever and
do syncopation off of that.

53
00:03:22.547 --> 00:03:23.950
According to this pattern.

54
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.330
One, two, ready go.

55
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:32.410
Da da da da da da da da da
da da da da da da da da

56
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:39.610
da da da da da da da da da da da
da da da da da da, da, da, dum.

57
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.960
Okay, good,
I see Daniel down here's got this nailed.

58
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.860
Okay.

59
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.320
So that's what syncopation is and
it isn't much more difficult than that.

60
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.750
But if syncopation is hearing
an accent off the beat,

61
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.150
how is it that composers tell
us initially where the beat is?

62
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.880
And what the meter is?

63
00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.880
Crucial here is the phenomenon
of the downbeat.

64
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.770
The most stressed and
always the first sound of every measure.

65
00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.860
It's called the downbeat
among other reasons,

66
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:12.010
because the conductor's hand always goes
down with the first beat in every measure.

67
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:18.379
One, two, one, two, or one,
two, three, one, two, three.

68
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.420
Composers are always sending us messages.

69
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.170
Messages in musical sound,
not spoken words.

70
00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.280
There are four ways that composers signal
to us where the downbeat is in music.

71
00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:37.890
Four ways they tell us where to stomp our
foot most loudly to get things organized.

72
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.480
In fact, when you dance,
you've gotta get the composer's message.

73
00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.870
You've gotta get a sense of where
the downbeat is or you can't proceed.

74
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.794
So here's how composers tell
us where the downbeat is.

75
00:04:49.794 --> 00:04:58.210
Through duration, through accent, through
range, and through change of harmony.

76
00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.060
Exactly how this works is
shown in the next class video.

77
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.660
Okay, way number one.

78
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.060
Way number one.

79
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.620
That has to do with duration, duration.

80
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.779
Notes are simply longer.

81
00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:17.661
Held longer.

82
00:05:17.661 --> 00:05:20.633
That's how we have a sense
of where the downbeat is.

83
00:05:20.633 --> 00:05:30.633
[MUSIC]

84
00:05:53.116 --> 00:05:53.790
Beautiful.

85
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.438
I guess it's a spiritual.

86
00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:57.087
Beautiful music.

87
00:05:57.087 --> 00:05:58.270
But think about that.

88
00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.036
[MUSIC]

89
00:05:59.036 --> 00:06:05.448
Short long, short long,
short long, short long,

90
00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:10.273
short long, short long, short long.

91
00:06:10.273 --> 00:06:14.050
And all of those long notes
are coming on the downbeat.

92
00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.672
So that's how we start to
hear that as a downbeat.

93
00:06:16.672 --> 00:06:19.820
And that's how we know to make
our hand go down at that point.

94
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.010
So that's one way.

95
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:23.860
Now another way is through accent.

96
00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.590
And to exemplify this let's turn to some
classical music, the music of Mozart.

97
00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.370
So here we have Mozart's 40th Symphony.

98
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:35.720
His famous G minor symphony, and
Linda, go ahead and start to play it.

99
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.388
Just go ahead.

100
00:06:39.388 --> 00:06:42.639
Maybe a second or two before it pops up,
but it's gonna come up.

101
00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:52.639
[MUSIC]

102
00:07:04.696 --> 00:07:06.610
Several of you were
actually conducting this.

103
00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:07.260
That's great.

104
00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.080
That's great.
Okay this happens to be in duple meter and

105
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:10.840
that's fine.

106
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.180
That wasn't the question here but great.

107
00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.153
You're hearing that and I'm delighted.

108
00:07:15.153 --> 00:07:19.652
What Mozart has done here, if we could
get the score up here of Mozart's music,

109
00:07:19.652 --> 00:07:23.209
we would see that he has put
a little sort of arrow, over top of,

110
00:07:23.209 --> 00:07:25.577
a wedge over top of each of the downbeats.

111
00:07:25.577 --> 00:07:33.355
[MUSIC]

112
00:07:33.355 --> 00:07:35.932
So that the string player
will really accent those.

113
00:07:35.932 --> 00:07:38.910
But the string player would
be accenting them anyway.

114
00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:41.350
Why?
Any violinists in here, or

115
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:43.000
anybody ever played a stringed instrument?

116
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.930
What are you always told to do?

117
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:49.115
If you are playing a downbeat with
an up bow, are you in good shape?

118
00:07:49.115 --> 00:07:50.700
No, no, no, no, no.

119
00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.670
Your teacher would not be happy with that,

120
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:56.000
your bowing pattern is probably
backward at that point.

121
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.760
String players are taught, whether it's
cellists going this way, downbeat, or

122
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:05.820
violas and violinists coming down this way
that the downward motion of the hand or

123
00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:09.940
the strong pull across should
come with the downbeat.

124
00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:11.360
That emphasizes the downbeat.

125
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.160
That's how we know the downbeat.

126
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.600
So, so far we've had duration and accent.

127
00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.340
Mozart is actually
writing accent into this.

128
00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:23.900
The third way that composers signal to us,
that we pick up almost intuitively,

129
00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:29.870
the whereabouts of downbeats is
through patterns of accompaniment.

130
00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:32.586
We'll call it range.

131
00:08:32.586 --> 00:08:37.659
Here's a waltz by Ricard Strauss, not to
be confused excuse me, by Johann Strauss,

132
00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:41.548
not to be confused with Ricard Strauss,
that we heard last time.

133
00:08:41.548 --> 00:08:51.548
[MUSIC]

134
00:08:54.295 --> 00:08:55.294
>> And so on.

135
00:08:55.294 --> 00:08:57.360
What is important here is the left hand.

136
00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:02.004
>> [MUSIC]

137
00:09:02.004 --> 00:09:04.080
>> That's why we hear
a triple pattern here.

138
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.670
We're hearing two weak beats and

139
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:08.660
the strong beat is always
in the lower position here.

140
00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:12.720
So we're getting low, middle,
middle, low, middle, middle.

141
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.490
Or it could be something as we had
the other day in the Tchaikovsky

142
00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:16.550
piano concerto.

143
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:19.900
Low, middle, high, low, middle,high.

144
00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:23.890
But each time the downbeat
seems to be coming

145
00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:26.150
in association with that lowest note.

146
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:29.860
So, range or
position here in the accompaniment can

147
00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:33.340
often times signal this information to us.

148
00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.300
And finally, and

149
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:40.040
most important, these others I think
have been pretty straight forward.

150
00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.470
These others have been
pretty straight forward.

151
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:47.820
But, what has not been straight
forward is something that you might

152
00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:53.270
listen to many, many times, and not be
aware of, and that is chord changes.

153
00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:56.009
If you know that we have chords in music.

154
00:09:56.009 --> 00:10:00.768
[MUSIC]

155
00:10:00.768 --> 00:10:03.430
Sort of these building blocks
that support a melody.

156
00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:07.690
And they have to change for
that melody to be consonant all the time.

157
00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:11.190
But where they change,
often times, is on the downbeat.

158
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:14.350
Most frequently,
chord changes come on the downbeat.

159
00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:18.440
So, composers signal to us in
a fourth way, the downbeat,

160
00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.010
by means of chord change.

161
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:22.800
Now, we're gonna play you just
a little bit of pop music.

162
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.450
Not too loud, Linda,
'cuz this thing is really hyped up.

163
00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:27.430
But let's listen to a little of this.

164
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:29.560
It's in a straight forward four.

165
00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:33.160
Rock really comes forth not so
much in twos but in fours, so

166
00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:37.400
we'll call this a four four and you can
kind of beat a four pattern to it, or

167
00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.520
you can beat a two pattern,
it doesn't really matter.

168
00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:44.140
But notice that whenever the chords are
changing, they're changing on downbeats.

169
00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:47.992
So let's hear a little bit of this and
then we'll stop so they don't sue us for

copyright infringement, when we go
somewhere else and take another chunk.

171
00:10:51.856 --> 00:10:55.432
[MUSIC]

172
00:10:55.432 --> 00:10:56.198
Okay, listen.

173
00:10:56.198 --> 00:10:59.588
[MUSIC]

174
00:10:59.588 --> 00:11:00.330
Change.

175
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:06.020
[MUSIC]

176
00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:06.948
Change.

177
00:11:06.948 --> 00:11:09.896
[MUSIC]

178
00:11:09.896 --> 00:11:10.803
Change.

179
00:11:10.803 --> 00:11:21.692
[MUSIC]

180
00:11:21.692 --> 00:11:23.905
Okay, so that's all they're doing there.

181
00:11:23.905 --> 00:11:26.365
They're just taking every
time their changing, and

182
00:11:26.365 --> 00:11:30.575
also every time I say change, and
eventually you'd be saying change too.

183
00:11:30.575 --> 00:11:33.361
Every time they're changing,
your hand is going down.

184
00:11:33.361 --> 00:11:34.777
Your hand is going down.

185
00:11:34.777 --> 00:11:39.819
So chord changes may be
the most powerful of all

186
00:11:39.819 --> 00:11:44.482
of these aspects of where the downbeat is.
