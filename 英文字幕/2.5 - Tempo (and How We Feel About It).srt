[MUSIC]

2
00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.467
Finally, one last thing that has
to do with duration in music.

3
00:00:14.467 --> 00:00:15.262
And that is tempo.

4
00:00:15.262 --> 00:00:17.213
That's a very simple idea.

5
00:00:17.213 --> 00:00:19.060
Life has a tempo, and so does music.

6
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.170
Tempo in music is simply
the speed of the beat.

7
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.510
We have a moderate tempo,
which is actually called moderato.

8
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.450
And we have faster tempos
that are called allegro.

9
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.670
And very fast there are vivace and
prestissimo, and you get the idea.

10
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.640
And we have slower ones called adagio and
lento, that sort of thing.

11
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.230
We can represent this on a slide
that shows us the different

12
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.240
tempos and
the number of beats per minute here.

13
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.380
Let's try this one.

14
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.057
We're gonna start all the way at the top

15
00:00:56.057 --> 00:01:00.960
here with lento, very slow tempo.

16
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.060
Gonna move this up in the middle

17
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.983
now at about moderato,

18
00:01:09.983 --> 00:01:14.886
then up to allegro, vivace,

19
00:01:14.886 --> 00:01:21.174
presto and ultimately prestissimo.

20
00:01:25.026 --> 00:01:28.160
And just a final word about tempo.

21
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.620
We can speed it up or slow it down.

22
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:37.020
If I speed it up, I create an accelerando,
just the Italian word for acceleration.

23
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.050
Similarly, if I slow it down,
I create a ritardando, a retard.

24
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.600
Now normally in music, we like to
have a steady beat, steady tempo.

25
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.950
And that usually happens in pop music
where there is a steady beat, and

26
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.380
especially in rock where there's
a hard-driving steady beat

27
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.250
to which you can dance.

28
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.070
We dance to a steady tempo.

29
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.247
But in classical music,
which is rarely dance music,

30
00:02:02.247 --> 00:02:05.720
musicians like to play with the notion
of tempo just a little bit.

31
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.641
Nuance the beat ever so
slightly at moments that are important to

32
00:02:09.641 --> 00:02:13.290
the articulation of
the structure of the piece.

33
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.190
They delay the beat just a little,
maybe push ahead here, pull back there.

34
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.970
I could play the following passage by
Robert Schumann very regularly, and

35
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.330
it would sound one way, or
with slight variation in tempo and

36
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.340
it would sound another.

37
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.640
Let's patch in a bit of video played
from a good Steinway playing the beat

38
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.150
at first in a steady fashion,
and then nuancing it slightly.

39
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.090
Okay, so
now we're gonna do a little experiment.

40
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.080
We're gonna differentiate what happens
when you play exactly on the beat,

41
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.070
exactly on tempo.

42
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.580
As opposed to what happens when you
loosen things up a little bit and

43
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.720
allow the beat to be nuanced ever so
slightly.

44
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.608
To make sure that we're really are staying
on the beat, let's turn on this gadget.

45
00:02:59.608 --> 00:03:04.209
Once again, this is our metronome, and
this will give us a beat here, three,

46
00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.255
four, one, two, three, four.

47
00:03:06.255 --> 00:03:16.255
[MUSIC]

48
00:03:28.955 --> 00:03:34.577
[NOISE] Get out of my face,
get out of here.

49
00:03:34.577 --> 00:03:39.430
[LAUGH] So,
let's try it now a different sort of way.

50
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.829
Let me play with the beat and
the tempo ever so slightly.

51
00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.651
Pushing it ahead here when
I feel that that's what

52
00:03:45.651 --> 00:03:47.665
the rhetoric of the music demands,

53
00:03:47.665 --> 00:03:51.844
pulling back here when we're coming
up to a major point of articulation.

54
00:03:51.844 --> 00:03:54.354
Same music, but without the metronome.

55
00:03:54.354 --> 00:04:04.354
[MUSIC]

56
00:04:22.307 --> 00:04:26.688
Cognitive psychologists have done
studies that show that we respond

57
00:04:26.688 --> 00:04:30.312
emotionally much more favorably
to music that is every so

58
00:04:30.312 --> 00:04:34.400
slightly off the beat, ever so
slightly off pitch now and then.

59
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.850
Next time you listen to your favorite
pop singer, just listen to how he or

60
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:45.500
she can be slightly off pitch at
one moment or slightly off tempo

61
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:51.710
at one moment, and then pull it back on.

62
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.530
That moment of intentional
imperfection of the beat or the pitch,

63
00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.560
that adds emotional intensity
to our musical experience.

64
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.920
Predictably, reality is on the beat.

65
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.880
Art is slightly off the beat,
slightly off beat.

66
00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.207
Art makes reality a lot more exciting.
