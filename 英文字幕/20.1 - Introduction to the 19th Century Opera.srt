2
00:00:15.896 --> 00:00:17.930
>> Have you ever been to an opera?

3
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.090
You ever seen an opera live on per son or
broadcast on television or

4
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.050
in high definition HD at a movie theater?

5
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.310
If you like opera, many people do,
many people don't.

6
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.540
Why not?

7
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.800
Who do some people not like Opera?

8
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.670
But many people do love opera.

9
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.140
Students, retirees, everyday folk,
and I happen to be one of them.

10
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.560
And you don't need a lot
of money to see opera live.

11
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:54.155
You can do so now via HD broadcast and
movie theaters around the world.

12
00:00:54.155 --> 00:00:59.480
It'll cost a movie ticket and
the quality is very, very good.

13
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.150
Online brings opera to everyone,

14
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.589
just like digital education brings
education to everyone in our digital age.

15
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.290
So I'm a big proponent of the art
form of opera, and it's my job here

16
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.950
to convince you of the power, the beauty,
and yes, even the glamour of opera.

17
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.340
Let's start with a quick review of
what we've learned up to this point

18
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.190
in our course about opera.

19
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.300
Which composers have we studied?

20
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.406
And by way of a,
are you paying attention quiz,

21
00:01:31.406 --> 00:01:34.701
which one person have we not studied?

22
00:01:38.536 --> 00:01:41.210
Well, you see the names here.

23
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:48.220
And, of course, we have not studied
an opera by the magician Harry Houdini.

24
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.810
He didn't write any.

25
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.350
But we had looked at parts
of operas by Monteverdi and

26
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.350
Purcell and Handel and Mozart.

27
00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.080
And now, as we come into the Romantic era,

28
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.290
to simplify it greatly,
we see two strong operatic traditions.

29
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.010
The first, of course,
is the Italian tradition.

30
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.140
The Italians started opera.

31
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.740
Wait a minute, you'll say,
Handel was German and Mozart,

32
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.400
well he came from Austria.

33
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.760
They weren't Italian.

34
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.160
Yes, that's true, but both made a living
as opera composers writing Italian opera.

35
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.140
The other tradition that develops,

36
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.660
somewhat later,
is the German operatic tradition.

37
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.860
We'll omit the French and
the English here for the moment.

38
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:31.790
The German tradition.

39
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.380
Well Mozart, Weber, Wagner, Strauss, and

40
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.450
carrying us into the 20th Century
Schoenberg and his pupil Alban Berg.

41
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.270
But how do we know that these
are the dominant traditions?

42
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.390
Who says that they are?

43
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.500
Who says what matters?

44
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.790
Well the people do.

45
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.660
The people who go to opera houses.

46
00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.490
Let's look at the operas offered by
the metropolitan opera of New York City.

47
00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.760
New York is very much an international
city, so it's representative.

48
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.770
When adding up the numbers for
one recent season

49
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.280
I came to see that the operas of
Giuseppe Verdi and Mozart dominate.

50
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.390
But the absence of German
opera surprised me.

51
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.500
So I went back one year and
looked at the repertoire for that season.

52
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.450
And it seemed to be more typical.

53
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.830
Richard Wagner was more prominent.

54
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.210
Again, the Italian
tradition with Verde and

55
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.150
now the German tradition
with Wagner dominate.

56
00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.500
And that's what we'll be talking
about briefly in this session.

57
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.980
The important thing to note is this,
in both Metropolitan Opera seasons,

58
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.290
opera is written during the 19th century,
the romantic era, dominate the stage.

59
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.060
About three-quarters of
the opera that we hear today,

60
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.800
they were composed in the Romantic period,
the 19th century.

61
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.510
Romantic escapism and
opera seem to go hand in hand.

62
00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.630
And just to make sure that we're all
back up to speed before proceeding,

63
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.540
here's a quick quiz for you to engage.

64
00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:15.830
We have six blanks and four terms,
so two of the terms get used twice.

65
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:16.397
Have a go at it.
