2
00:00:11.917 --> 00:00:16.016
Bel canto is a term that was frequently
heard in connection with opera,

3
00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:18.840
most especially with Italian opera.

4
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.950
And it applies to type of singing,
a type of music and a type of opera

5
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.870
that arose in Italy during the 1820s with
Rossini and then Bellini and Donizetti.

6
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:33.610
And continued with the operas of Giuseppe
Verdi and into those of Giacomo Puccini.

7
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.210
Literally, bel canto,

8
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.850
means beautiful singing, singing with
an especially rich, luxurious tone.

9
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.440
Although that sound can sometimes
be intense and dramatic as well.

10
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.250
As a type of music, bel canto means that
the music of the opera is focused almost

11
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.700
entirely on the aria.

12
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.190
And that the music of the aria has
focused entirely on the voice,

13
00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.540
the beautiful lyrical tones of the voice.

14
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.902
To be blunt, in bel canto opera,
the accompanying orchestra

15
00:01:06.902 --> 00:01:11.213
has little to do except
plunk out supporting chords.

16
00:01:11.213 --> 00:01:14.150
It's in a way, under employed.

17
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.020
Let's look for
example at an aria here, Casta diva.

18
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.860
You can see the very simple accompaniment.

19
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:29.391
Only tonic and dominant chords
strung out as an arpeggio here.

20
00:01:29.391 --> 00:01:39.391
[MUSIC]

21
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:42.720
And so on.

22
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.510
Sounds like a guitar
strumming in the background,

23
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.230
hence the expression big guitar effect.

24
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.080
Because of the simple nature
of the accompaniment,

25
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.870
all of the attention is
focused on the soprano voice.

26
00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.280
In this case, we had the auria Casta diva,
Chase goddess from Bellini's opera Norma.

27
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.540
Here Norma sings about the Chase goddess,
the moon.

28
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.750
Although the chase women of
the opera is Norma herself.

29
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:18.120
By coincidence this notion of the Diva,
the goddess, becomes a word to denote

30
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.670
the female goddess of the opera,
the perhaps temperamental soprano.

31
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.850
It's a term we begin to hear in the 19th
century associated with a female singer

32
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:36.150
in a similar way as we associate
the term prima donna, or first lady.

33
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.180
Maybe first temperamental lady.

34
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.530
Anyway, let's get to the signing.

35
00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.360
Again, here the orchestra just
plays a few chords as arpeggios and

36
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.290
then gets out of the way.

37
00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.440
In this classic example
of bel canto signing,

38
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.450
you'll hear the late Australian
soprano Joan Sutherland.

39
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.238
She's the diva here.

40
00:02:56.238 --> 00:03:06.238
[MUSIC]

41
00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:49.996
>> So
that was the soprano singing bel canto.

42
00:03:49.996 --> 00:03:54.460
But there are various kinds of
sopranos as this next slide suggests.

43
00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.000
There is the coloratura,
a high, light, agile voice.

44
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.230
There are also three other
types of sopranos, first lyric.

45
00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.820
We usually associate that
with bel conto singing.

46
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.150
Perhaps the best known of these
lyric sopranos is Renee Fleming,

47
00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.368
with her incomparable vocal control.

48
00:04:14.368 --> 00:04:19.720
Then there's a type of voice that
pushes itself just a bit toward

49
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.530
the dramatic side,
called spina vocce, lyrica spinta.

50
00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.466
And then the dramatic soprano,
that's called for

51
00:04:28.466 --> 00:04:30.997
most obviously when
a huge sound is needed.

52
00:04:30.997 --> 00:04:35.305
For example, to sail above the large
orchestra in the operas of Wagner.

53
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.010
Then of course, there's the slightly
lower soprano called the mezzo.

54
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.170
Mezzo, halfway.

55
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.740
Halfway between soprano and alto.

56
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.680
And then the low alto,
which in opera is called the contralto.

57
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.720
As to the men, well of course,
we have the tenor.

58
00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:01.146
In the 19th century, around 1830 or
so, the tenor voice finally and

59
00:05:01.146 --> 00:05:05.838
definitively replaced
the castrato as the male lead.

60
00:05:05.838 --> 00:05:11.656
So the hero, henceforth in opera is the
tenor, with there being lyrical tenors and

61
00:05:11.656 --> 00:05:16.370
the more dramatic ones,
again for Wagnerian operas.

62
00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.800
Between tenor and bass,
we have the baritone or varitones,

63
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.500
variable voice because it could swing
between low tenor and high bass.

64
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.590
And, finally, bass itself.

65
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.070
What makes a great singer?

66
00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.630
Well, natural gift, good training,
and of course hard work.

67
00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:41.660
As to natural gift, we might take a look
at this image of Joan Sutherland who for

68
00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.360
my money was the greatest
soprano that I ever heard.

69
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.350
She can do it all, from contralto to
coloratura and with a huge volume.

70
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.258
But she did have perhaps
a somewhat unusual physiogonmy.

71
00:05:54.258 --> 00:05:58.965
An elongated head in a body
standing 6'3 tall was her stature,

72
00:05:58.965 --> 00:06:03.890
in some way a reflection of
her exceptional vocal chords.

73
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:08.430
By way of comparison,
the body of seven time gold medal winning

74
00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.320
swimmer Michael Phelps, who's said to
have the body of a shark, small waist,

75
00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.420
huge shoulders,
a perfect swimming machine.

76
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:21.041
But maybe I'm getting in over
my head here so let's move on.
