[MUSIC]

2
00:00:11.794 --> 00:00:16.485
Well as we saw in an earlier segment,
judging from the number of operas

3
00:00:16.485 --> 00:00:22.469
performed at a typical, large opera house,
the reigning king of opera Giuseppe Verdi.

4
00:00:22.469 --> 00:00:24.670
He gets more performances
than anyone else.

5
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:25.230
More than Mozart.

6
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.330
More than Wagner.

7
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.861
Why are Verdi's operas so popular?

8
00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:31.531
In a word, they're never bored.

9
00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:35.231
That's the key to a success
as a dramaturgist,

10
00:00:35.231 --> 00:00:40.680
as someone crafting great theater,
making drama work in a theater.

11
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.320
As Verdi, himself, said,
quote, there's only

12
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.130
one thing that the public won't tolerate
in the theater, and that's boredom.

13
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.710
End quote.

14
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.150
Verdi avoids boredom by means of action
filled librettos, lots of romance,

15
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.070
lots of intrigue, and murders galore.

16
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.925
And as you can see by the slide here,
three of his librettos are based on

17
00:01:03.925 --> 00:01:08.303
action packed plays of Shakespeare,
two involving murders.

18
00:01:08.303 --> 00:01:10.671
Macbeth and Othello.

19
00:01:10.671 --> 00:01:16.030
And Verdi's music too, is action packed,
but what does that mean?

20
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.299
Action packed music.

21
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.170
In what way can music be action packed?

22
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.890
Well, with Verdi it's condensed.

23
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.070
A lot happens in Verdi's music
in a brief amount of time.

24
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.500
And as in Beethoven's music,

25
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.900
there's never any ambiguity as to how
we're supposed to feel about the music.

26
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.350
Now Verdi wants us to feel this sensation.

27
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.470
Now that sensation.

28
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:42.470
Now this emotion.

29
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.260
Now that emotion.
Emotions are obvious and

30
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.060
they come quickly one after another.

31
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.458
So, Verdi's operas rarely
are enormously subtle.

32
00:01:53.458 --> 00:01:56.755
You want really subtle things
in opera go listen to Mozart.

33
00:01:56.755 --> 00:01:59.391
Go listen to the Marriage of Figaro,
for example.

34
00:01:59.391 --> 00:02:01.080
But if you want banner
headlines of emotion, well.

35
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.440
Verdi is your go to person.

36
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.905
To see how this works, let's listen,
not to an aria as you might expect, but

37
00:02:10.905 --> 00:02:16.724
to an overture by Verdi that's just
purely instrumental, instrumental music.

38
00:02:16.724 --> 00:02:20.350
The overture is short,
it lasts only two minutes.

39
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.230
Which tells us a lot about various
capacity for dramatic compression.

40
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.966
How he can pack in many
contrasting emotions within just

41
00:02:27.966 --> 00:02:29.780
a short period of time.

42
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.470
The piece in question is
the overture to his opera, MacBeth.

43
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.403
Let's give a listen as Ricardo Muti
conducts, and I'll comment as we go.

44
00:02:38.403 --> 00:02:42.477
[MUSIC]

45
00:02:42.477 --> 00:02:46.169
Here begin with music that
sounds somewhat non-committal.

46
00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:53.610
Maybe a lot of movement onstage.

47
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.119
But then, oh.

48
00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:57.910
You know this is not going to end well.

49
00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.520
Notice those low brass.

50
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.400
Trombones to the right, tuba.

51
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.347
[MUSIC]

52
00:03:05.347 --> 00:03:05.962
Ooh.

53
00:03:05.962 --> 00:03:15.795
[MUSIC]

54
00:03:15.795 --> 00:03:17.594
A little suspense building up.

55
00:03:17.594 --> 00:03:18.660
[MUSIC]

56
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.180
Aha, low trombones again,

57
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:27.170
probably coming up here in seventh
cord falling melodic sequence.

58
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.906
[MUSIC]

59
00:03:31.906 --> 00:03:38.280
But that idea doesn't last for long.

60
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.358
Dominant chord and tonic resolve.

61
00:03:42.358 --> 00:03:45.549
The lovely lyrical flowing.

62
00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:49.670
[MUSIC]

63
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.082
It could well be sung,
it's about conto aria.

64
00:03:54.082 --> 00:04:04.082
[MUSIC]

65
00:04:05.796 --> 00:04:10.494
And that too, doesn't last too long,
as we slide away to more diminished and

66
00:04:10.494 --> 00:04:11.450
minor chords.

67
00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.352
[MUSIC]

68
00:04:14.352 --> 00:04:16.871
Tension builds, rising melodic sequence.

69
00:04:16.871 --> 00:04:18.636
[MUSIC]

70
00:04:18.636 --> 00:04:20.169
Whoops, no this is falling.

71
00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:25.787
[MUSIC]

72
00:04:25.787 --> 00:04:27.645
Another hold cadence.

73
00:04:27.645 --> 00:04:30.814
[MUSIC]

74
00:04:30.814 --> 00:04:32.823
There's that lovely melody, back.

75
00:04:32.823 --> 00:04:41.228
[MUSIC]

76
00:04:41.228 --> 00:04:44.890
A very simple accompaniment
underneath that melody.

77
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.450
Again, typical of bel canto.

78
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:52.197
And you can begin to hear a fade out.

79
00:04:52.197 --> 00:04:58.361
[MUSIC]

80
00:04:58.361 --> 00:05:04.178
Rising, minor trial, withholds and

81
00:05:04.178 --> 00:05:07.823
then intensity grows.

82
00:05:07.823 --> 00:05:17.860
Compression, intensity,
maximum drama in minimum time.

83
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.740
Sometimes maybe even
really obvious emotions.

84
00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.810
And it's never dull, and it's often very
beautiful, and surely this in many ways

85
00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:32.590
accounts for various great popularity
with opera goers around the world.

86
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:33.961
Tip five.

87
00:05:33.961 --> 00:05:38.186
By his, perhaps,
most popular opera, La Traveata.
