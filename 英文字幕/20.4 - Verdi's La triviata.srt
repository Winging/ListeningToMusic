[MUSIC]

2
00:00:15.755 --> 00:00:21.071
Well, if you have to choose just one
among Verdi's many successful operas,

3
00:00:21.071 --> 00:00:22.561
which do you choose?

4
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.550
Which will most quickly give you
a sense of what Verdi's all about?

5
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.300
Well I'd recommend La Traviata.

6
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.260
It's about love.

7
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.990
It's about disappointment in love.

8
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.720
And it's about death.

9
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.320
So there are plenty of
emotions to go around here.

10
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.019
And there is also a lot of very exciting
and a lot of very beautiful music.

11
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.290
Now of course in five minutes we
can't go through an entire two and

12
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.920
a half hour opera.

13
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.680
So here's what I suggest.

14
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.890
Here you might take advantage
of the recommended textbook,

15
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.730
The Essential Listening to Music,
where I lead you through the entire opera.

16
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.960
But you could also watch
the opera on YouTube.

17
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.170
But let's push on.

18
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.428
The title, La traviata, in Italian
means the woman who has gone astray.

19
00:01:09.428 --> 00:01:14.122
La, the feminine article
on the other side of

20
00:01:14.122 --> 00:01:18.990
tra via, the road,
the wrong side of the tracks if you will.

21
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.707
And here, to the left, we see that woman.

22
00:01:21.707 --> 00:01:26.620
Verdi's libretto is based on a true
life story of the relationship between

23
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:32.080
Marie Duplessis and the raider, Alexandra
Dumas, the younger, on the right.

24
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.110
His father wrote The Three Musketeers, and
the Count of Monte Christo, among others.

25
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.925
Dumas the younger turned this
true life story into a play, and

26
00:01:41.925 --> 00:01:44.500
Verdi based his opera on the play.

27
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.800
The play was also turned into a ballet,
with music by Chopin.

28
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.390
And into a film in the 1930s
with the glamorous Greta Garbo.

29
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.120
Marie Duplessis was a social phenomenon.

30
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.520
She was a courtesan, in a word, a high
class prostitute, a high class hooker.

31
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.690
She had many lovers including pianist
Franz Liszt, but she died young

32
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.700
at the age of 23 of tuberculosis, the same
disease that claimed the life of Chopin.

33
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.130
Marie's short, scandalous, sensational
life was well known in the day,

34
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.520
as you can see by the comment upon her
death by none other than Charles Dickens,

35
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.730
who compared her notoriety to
that of the famous Joan of Arc.

36
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.300
Okay, let's meet
the characters in our opera.

37
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.230
Here we have the representation
on stage of Marie Duplessis,

38
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.655
Violetta, she's the heroine, the soprano.

39
00:02:44.655 --> 00:02:49.620
Her lover of course,
the hero is Alfredo, a tenor.

40
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.560
Alfredo's father well that's Germont,
an authority figure who

41
00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.340
attempts to place discord between the two.

42
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.960
And here, finally, the villain of the
opera who is sometimes Alfredo's lover and

43
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.820
protector Baron Douphol,
bass baritone voice.

44
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.620
In terms of action, well in the first
act they meet, they fall in love, but

45
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.460
she vows at the end of it to remain free.

46
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.590
In the second act they live
together happily for a while,

47
00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.300
but his father drives them apart.

48
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.850
Third act, she returns to Baron Douphol.

49
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.880
Alfredo fights a duel with him and
is banished to Italy.

50
00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.390
Violetta is dying of
tuberculosis back in Paris,

51
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.800
Alfredo races back to rejoin her,
but it's too late.

52
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.720
Once again,
we have this convention of the heroine

53
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.040
dying at the end of a romantic opera.

54
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.830
She sings her last and then dies.

55
00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.780
Violetta, Tosca, Mimi, Isolde, Carmen,
as we'll see later in our session today,

56
00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.490
even Brunhilde.

57
00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.705
The romantic convention of long
love gone tragically awry.

58
00:04:04.002 --> 00:04:05.940
All right,
well let's listen to some of the music.

59
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.770
We'll start with the first
act here where the hero,

60
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.330
Alfredo, first professes his love for
Violetta.

61
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.430
He does so in an aria.

62
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:20.440
Well, actually it's a duet,
which Violetta joins in on.

63
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:27.310
Alfredo's aria begins low and slow,
sometimes with a minor twinge to it.

64
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.960
Love is serious.

65
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.520
And notice the simple oom
pah pah accompaniment.

66
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.590
The orchestra again provides only
the simplest sort of accompaniment

67
00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.020
to the tenor, in this case,
tenor bel canto voice.

68
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.090
Let me play just a bit for you,
of the accompaniment on the piano.

69
00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.790
It is indeed very simple.

70
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.504
It starts here.

71
00:04:48.504 --> 00:04:58.504
[MUSIC]

72
00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.504
Couldn't be simpler.

73
00:05:04.504 --> 00:05:14.504
[MUSIC]

74
00:05:46.296 --> 00:05:48.710
>> Okay, we'll just pause it here.

75
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.960
Notice in this opening passage that we're
coming along in a slow triple, one, two,

76
00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.810
three, one, two, three, and how the singer
and conductor slowed way, way down there.

77
00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.880
Well this is called tempo rubato.

78
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:08.910
Slow way down so that the singer here,
Luciano Pavarotti,

79
00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:14.394
could luxuriate in that
slide from the leading

80
00:06:14.394 --> 00:06:19.754
tone up into the tonic
[SOUND] in that fashion.

81
00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:22.304
Let's listen to this one more time, and

82
00:06:22.304 --> 00:06:27.337
we'll focus on the rise of the leading
tone into the tonic and the tempo rubato.

83
00:06:27.337 --> 00:06:37.337
[MUSIC]

84
00:06:51.462 --> 00:06:55.431
>> A great example of the flexibility
of tempo in the romantic period and

85
00:06:55.431 --> 00:06:59.468
a leading tone pulling into the tonic,
and a great sound, of course,

86
00:06:59.468 --> 00:07:02.360
Pavarotti has the voice to
make this all his work.

87
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:07.270
When Violetta entered,
she brightens things up.

88
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:10.050
She sings higher,
lighter, always in major.

89
00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:12.470
Soon the voices join rapturously,

90
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:16.940
the musical intervals embracing
sweet sounds, the thirds and sixths.

91
00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:21.420
And as you listen, notice the role of
the orchestra, as the duet proceeds.

92
00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:22.462
Here's a question for you.

93
00:07:22.462 --> 00:07:26.212
What does the orchestra
do here at the climax?

94
00:07:26.212 --> 00:07:37.087
[MUSIC]

95
00:07:37.087 --> 00:07:40.296
>> Okay, now we're coming to
the top of the page here.

96
00:07:40.296 --> 00:07:45.921
[MUSIC]

97
00:07:45.921 --> 00:07:49.301
>> Now they're about to go off, jump off.

98
00:07:49.301 --> 00:07:59.301
[MUSIC]

99
00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:35.840
Well, what did the orchestra
do at the climax?

100
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:36.990
Absolutely nothing.

101
00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:38.820
It stopped playing entirely.

102
00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.490
Only at the end, the second blue arrow,

103
00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:46.710
does the orchestra return
with a few tonic chords.

104
00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:51.280
And again, note that Alfredo and
Violetta have the same rhythms here.

105
00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.770
They're very much in sync.

106
00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:56.220
They're very much together,
sweetly in love.

107
00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:04.370
They are sweet on one another,
in sweet sounding thirds and sixths.

108
00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:04.960
So here we are.

109
00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.651
Let me see if I can dig this out.

110
00:09:06.651 --> 00:09:14.441
[MUSIC]

111
00:09:14.441 --> 00:09:15.869
Thirds and sixths.

112
00:09:15.869 --> 00:09:20.768
[MUSIC]

113
00:09:20.768 --> 00:09:22.707
There is six two third.

114
00:09:22.707 --> 00:09:25.586
And then the orchestra
comes back in simply.

115
00:09:25.586 --> 00:09:34.687
[MUSIC]

116
00:09:34.687 --> 00:09:38.647
Well as we proceed to the end of this
first act we see that Violetta is

117
00:09:38.647 --> 00:09:40.650
ambivalent about love.

118
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:46.270
Maybe she'd rather be by herself, be
better off without any serious commitment,

119
00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:50.880
be better off just enjoying life and
all it's earthly pleasures.

120
00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:57.720
Violetta tells us all this in a package
of musical items called a scena.

121
00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.540
Now a scena, of course, is simply
the Italian for the idea of a scene,

122
00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:05.680
a coherent sequence of
aria recitative aria.

123
00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.650
We'll start with the recitative.

124
00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:12.520
And note that now,
unlike the unaccompanied recitative

125
00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:17.470
just harpsichord or early piano,
only as we had with Mozart.

126
00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:21.600
Now, recitative is accompanied by
a large portion of the orchestra.

127
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:27.440
Now we have [FOREIGN] accompanied
recitative, of course.

128
00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:32.380
The recitative is followed
by what we call a cabaletta.

129
00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:37.930
A fast, concluding aria that allows the
signer to declaim something emphatically,

130
00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:41.540
in this case I will always remain free,
and then

131
00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:45.620
dramatically exit the stage as the curtain
falls to end the scene and the act.

132
00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:50.160
Here's Violetta's Recitative.

133
00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.844
We will follow along
with the English text.

134
00:10:53.844 --> 00:10:58.150
[MUSIC]

135
00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:59.333
>> We are at the top of the page.

136
00:10:59.333 --> 00:11:09.333
[MUSIC]

137
00:11:59.241 --> 00:12:03.325
>> And now the orchestra starts
out with the aria, the cabaletta.

138
00:12:03.325 --> 00:12:05.868
And it suddenly will break off and
then recommence.

139
00:12:05.868 --> 00:12:16.537
[MUSIC]

140
00:12:16.537 --> 00:12:20.600
>> Watch how sensual,
the dive way down in this difficult aria.

141
00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:25.523
[MUSIC]

142
00:12:25.523 --> 00:12:27.044
>> Low point.

143
00:12:27.044 --> 00:12:30.538
And immediately soar up high.

144
00:12:30.538 --> 00:12:32.744
High up into the sky with happy.

145
00:12:32.744 --> 00:12:43.203
[MUSIC]

146
00:12:43.203 --> 00:12:47.498
>> And she just repeats these words here.

147
00:12:47.498 --> 00:12:52.083
Soaring spirits.

148
00:12:52.083 --> 00:12:57.523
Soon Alfredo could be heard from outside

149
00:12:57.523 --> 00:13:02.333
the window outside reminding her.

150
00:13:02.333 --> 00:13:08.900
>> [FOREIGN]
>> Now his music.

151
00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:13.872
And seriously minor,
when the mystery of love.

152
00:13:13.872 --> 00:13:22.799
[MUSIC]

153
00:13:22.799 --> 00:13:27.552
A little dissonance here, hm,

154
00:13:27.552 --> 00:13:32.133
pain yet delight to the heart.

155
00:13:32.133 --> 00:13:41.374
[MUSIC]

156
00:13:41.374 --> 00:13:47.738
But, Violetta brushes off
the thought of true love, and

157
00:13:47.738 --> 00:13:52.786
after another vocal flourish, she begins.

158
00:13:52.786 --> 00:14:02.786
[MUSIC]

159
00:14:09.828 --> 00:14:12.092
Repeat the cabaletta.

160
00:14:12.092 --> 00:14:15.220
Okay let's pause it there.

161
00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:22.800
So here we begin to hear a scena,
repeat of the cabaletta

162
00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:27.255
with the vocal part growing
ever more dramatic and

163
00:14:27.255 --> 00:14:31.990
ever more virtuosic,
especially at the end.

164
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:36.690
Let's take a look at the end,
and we'll see what goes on.

165
00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:39.390
Okay, let's look at this slide here.

166
00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:43.110
I'll put on my glasses, and
we'll see if we can't find this page.

167
00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.570
Aha, I know we've got it here somewhere.

168
00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:51.720
So this is the very last page
of the first act of La Traviata.

169
00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:52.710
The soprano,

170
00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:56.250
well it's actually interesting to look at,
Verdi has written this two ways.

171
00:14:56.250 --> 00:15:02.058
As you can see the cursor up on top here,
one option is for just to have the singer,

172
00:15:02.058 --> 00:15:07.170
maybe a non-adventurous singer,
to come down and just rest here.

173
00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:12.070
A very high range singer,
one with a high vocal capacity,

174
00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:16.490
could go all the way up and execute
the syncopations on that super high C

175
00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:20.430
up there, and
then gradually make her way down, and

176
00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:25.720
then back up through a melodic sequence,
or repetition through here.

177
00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:26.880
Until we come to this spot.

178
00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.420
So let me play just a little bit for you.

179
00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:35.453
And I think I'll be starting about here,
focusing just on the melody.

180
00:15:35.453 --> 00:15:45.453
[MUSIC]

181
00:15:49.175 --> 00:15:51.474
Okay, that's what Verdi wrote.

182
00:15:51.474 --> 00:15:57.088
Now oftentimes in modern performances,
the soprano will be a bit more aggressive.

183
00:15:57.088 --> 00:15:59.747
So the soprano will be
coming up to this high note.

184
00:15:59.747 --> 00:16:06.909
[MUSIC]

185
00:16:06.909 --> 00:16:09.620
Go up there, to the A up above.

186
00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:14.300
But in this recording,
watch what Joan Sutherland does.

187
00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:15.680
It's really extraordinary.

188
00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.343
She's coming along in this fashion.

189
00:16:17.343 --> 00:16:20.102
[MUSIC]

190
00:16:20.102 --> 00:16:21.266
And then does this.

191
00:16:21.266 --> 00:16:25.091
[MUSIC]

192
00:16:25.091 --> 00:16:28.962
Jumps all the way up to that
super high E-flat and nobody did,

193
00:16:28.962 --> 00:16:30.760
Verdi didn't write at all.

194
00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.759
[MUSIC]

195
00:16:32.759 --> 00:16:37.760
And then brings it back to the tonic,
in that fashion, high down there.

196
00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:42.056
So listen to this performance
by Joan Sutherland.

197
00:16:42.056 --> 00:16:52.056
[MUSIC]

198
00:17:11.799 --> 00:17:15.960
>> Wow, that's really sort of
virtuosic fireworks there.

199
00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:19.680
Notice that it required her really to
add four or five additional bars, so

200
00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:24.130
that you get up there and sit and
really exploit that super high note.

201
00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:29.928
Well, that's the end of just
the first act of Verdi's La Traviata.

202
00:17:29.928 --> 00:17:34.220
I hope you'll go on to explore
the remainder of the opera on your own.

203
00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:38.390
But, a final thought.

204
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:42.670
We've talked a lot about
the female soprano voice here.

205
00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:44.770
And what about the tenor voice?

206
00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:50.010
Almost every great operatic tenor
has had a go at singing this role.

207
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:54.060
This role of Alfredo,
ever since Verdi created it.

208
00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:58.520
Here's another cabaletta,
this one from act two of La Traviata,

209
00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:04.120
in which Alfredo vows to avenge
the dishonor that's been heaped upon him.

210
00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:06.830
He will wash it away, the disgrace.

211
00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:11.183
And, for fun, let's hear three
performances of just a snippet of

212
00:18:11.183 --> 00:18:14.950
this aria, this cabaletta,
and you compare them.

213
00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:18.210
You get to be the judge,
you get to be critic.

214
00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.750
So, what are we gonna listen for here?

215
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:25.446
Well, as you can see, we wanna listen for,
among other things but

216
00:18:25.446 --> 00:18:27.800
not necessarily all in each recording.

217
00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:31.680
Quality of richness,
quality of the variation of the tone,

218
00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:35.600
the comfort level,
does the voice sound strained?

219
00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:39.400
Capacity to control the tone,
capacity to hold pitches.

220
00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:45.440
Especially the climactic and very high
final pitch, it's actually a high C.

221
00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:50.346
And the end, it's very important here,
as we'll see, and finally, the overall

222
00:18:50.346 --> 00:18:54.764
tempo of the performance, often
the greater the vocal control, and vocal

223
00:18:54.764 --> 00:18:59.559
control is a virtue here, the greater
the vocal control, the slower the tempo.

224
00:18:59.559 --> 00:19:05.310
So a slow tempo will suggest that this
singer has greater vocal command.

225
00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:11.430
So we're going to begin here
with a comparison of our tenors.

226
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:15.520
First we'll hear the great
Spanish Mexican tenor Placido Domingo,

227
00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:19.980
a skilled singer and
highly intelligent musician conductor.

228
00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:24.120
Both of these recordings,
by the way were studio recordings.

229
00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:28.990
The first Domingo 1977,
the second of Pavarotti in 1979.

230
00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:35.811
Let's begin with Placido Domingo
singing Dei miei bollenti spiriti.

231
00:19:35.811 --> 00:19:45.811
[MUSIC]

232
00:19:57.262 --> 00:20:01.012
>> Okay, so that's one presentation of it.

233
00:20:01.012 --> 00:20:06.382
Now a second, again, Luciano Pavarotti,

234
00:20:06.382 --> 00:20:09.871
1979, same material.

235
00:20:09.871 --> 00:20:19.871
[MUSIC]

236
00:20:54.135 --> 00:20:58.883
>> And finally now
the Hungarian Tenor Peter Kevol.

237
00:20:58.883 --> 00:21:01.406
Notice what he does in particular,

238
00:21:01.406 --> 00:21:06.283
notice what he does with the final pitch,
that difficult to get high C

239
00:21:06.283 --> 00:21:11.180
that's been a challenge to every
tenor who has attempted this role.

240
00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:21.180
[MUSIC]

241
00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:44.330
>> [APPLAUSE]
>> Well what did you think?

242
00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:49.442
Take a quick quiz on the performance of
these three singers and then if you wish,

243
00:21:49.442 --> 00:21:54.726
a second quiz that reinforces some of the
vocabulary that we have been employing.
