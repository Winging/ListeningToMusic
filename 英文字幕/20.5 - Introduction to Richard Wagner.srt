00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:12.987 --> 00:00:14.307
So here we are.

3
00:00:14.307 --> 00:00:18.110
We've got about 20 minutes to
talk about Richard Wagner.

4
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.170
This is a travesty.

5
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.030
Wagner is a huge subject.

6
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:28.190
Which composer has more books written
about him, Bach, Mozart, Verdi, or Wagner?

7
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.270
Well, Wagner.

8
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.610
Which composer changed the face
of 19th century music the most?

9
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.890
Well, a toss up here.

10
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.600
Certainly Beethoven, or perhaps Wagner.

11
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.840
Which composer it was.

12
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.640
The most original thinker and

13
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.750
creator in the entire history
of western musical theater.

14
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.570
Well arguably again Richard Wagner, but

15
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.780
although our time is short, let's get
going and lets make the most of it.

16
00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.160
Wagner was born here Leipzig Germany in
1813 the same years as Giuseppe Verdi.

17
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.470
And Wagner received a bit of musical
training here at this church.

18
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.638
In this church music school on right,
at the St.

19
00:01:09.638 --> 00:01:12.070
Thomas Church & church music school.

20
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.500
Who else worked here in this church?

21
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.496
And who lived in this house?

22
00:01:16.496 --> 00:01:22.340
Well, J.S. Bach of course, for 27 years.

23
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.630
But Wagner got only the smallest
sort of musical education here.

24
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.560
So in many ways, Wagner was an outlier.

25
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.980
Wagner exposure to music
was very different.

26
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.530
Unlike that of Bach,
Mozart, and Beethoven,

27
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.610
who you see on the left, think about
the upbringing of Wagner compared to them.

28
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.590
Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, well they
all came from a family of musicians.

29
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.690
They all had a father in the business.

30
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.660
Wagner was never sure who his father was,
and

31
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.500
he was essentially self-taught in music.

32
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.680
He was both pupil and teacher to himself.

33
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.020
To earn his daily bread,

34
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.920
young Wagner worked in theatres,
as a conductor, composing on the side.

35
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.170
For awhile, he nearly starved to death,
and in fact,

36
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.840
was thrown in debtor's prison in Paris.

37
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.390
But then his big break came.

38
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.500
It happened back here in Dresden,
as you can see by the red arrow.

39
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.680
When he was offered, and accepted,
the prestigious post of composer and

40
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.960
conductor here,
at the Semper Opera House in Dresden,

41
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.800
Germany, here, as we see it restored
after the second World War.

42
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.960
But with the Revolution of 1848,
Wagner became

43
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.680
a persona non grata in Germany and
fled to independent Switzerland.

44
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.792
And for the rest of his life he seems to
have lived off of other people's money.

45
00:02:53.792 --> 00:02:56.880
Off of the largess of one patron or
another.

46
00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.740
Here's the living room of his
house in Tribschen that he enjoyed

47
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.780
rent free, and
here's Wagner's living room.

48
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:14.430
Not so bad for a man with little or
no income, artist or con artist?

49
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.970
Well a little of both,
maybe a lot of both.

50
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.820
And here's the grand piano
that was provided for him.

51
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:28.220
Provided by his most generous patron,
King Ludwig of Bavaria.

52
00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.990
Mad King Ludwig as he was known.

53
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.590
He was the builder of the fantasy
castle Neuschwanstein.

54
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.500
Eventually King Ludwig
also supplied Wagner with

55
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.710
the money to build his own
theater in Bavaria in Bayreuth.

56
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.780
The Bayreuth Festival Hall,

57
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.310
where Wagner could produce his operas and
only his operas.

58
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.500
Or what Wagner came to
call his music dramas.

59
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.710
So here's an image, a slide,
a photograph actually

60
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.120
of what Bayreuth looked like as
the theater was being built.

61
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.010
And here's what it looked like
when it was finished in 1876.

62
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.660
Now, this is a fascinating image.

63
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.150
It's a bit of mythmaking and

64
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.510
a bit of marketing, a promotion for
a meat extract, a vitamin.

65
00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.160
And with this product,
each buyer received the free card.

66
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:27.130
It was much like American baseball cards
today or prizes in boxes of cereal.

67
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.670
On this card, we see an important moment.

68
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.080
Not only the dedication
of the new theater, but

69
00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.430
the presence of the new ruler,
Kaiser Wilhelm I.

70
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.540
Well, he's ruling
the newly unified Germany.

71
00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:48.770
Wagner is on the ascent, and, the German
nation is on the ascent as well.

72
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:55.310
Look at how much bigger Wagner has
gotten on the left of our picture,

73
00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:01.220
to the right there of Wagner is the,
let me see if I can identify it here.

74
00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.910
Here's Franz Liszt.

75
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.460
Short, white haired Franz Liszt.

76
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.560
Here's Richard Wagner, and point of fact,
Wagner is only three years younger than

77
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:16.590
Liszt and actually [LAUGH] much
shorter than Liszt, almost as a joke.

78
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.620
Let's take a look at this next
image where we see the two of them

79
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.510
standing next to a set
chair in similar positions.

80
00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.890
But in this image,
we see see the young looking Wagner, well,

81
00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:38.660
he's almost the equal in stature and
he's certainly taller than Liszt.

82
00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.490
Equal to stature to the Kaiser.

83
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.900
So, history here is being re-written.

84
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.410
Art in the service of politics.

85
00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.510
The image is making a cultural
statement about what

86
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.570
Germany thought it was at this time.

87
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.410
Germany loomed large and
Wagner loomed large.

88
00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:02.420
And here's the way Bayreuth looks today,
very much a center of German culture.

89
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.030
Let's go inside.

90
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.910
Inside we see an exceedingly
plain auditorium.

91
00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:11.240
Why so?

92
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.270
Well, Wagner was something
of an egomaniac and

93
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.640
he didn't want the audience to focus on
anything other than the music and drama.

94
00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.890
His music and drama.

95
00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.080
But Wagner was an innovator.

96
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:31.170
His theater was the first not to admit
late comers once the act had begun.

97
00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:35.790
His theater was the first to use
gas lighting instead of candles and

98
00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:39.490
this allowed for the dimming of
the lights during the performance.

99
00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:44.500
And Wagner was also the first to put
the orchestra completely under the stage,

100
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.470
in what's called the orchestral pit.

101
00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:54.190
So let's slide here left to right,
down into the pit over here.

102
00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:01.060
The audience would hear the music,
but not see the players.

103
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.949
Hear Wagner's music, but
not see who was producing it.

104
00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.230
Well, what music did Wagner introduce to

105
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:13.880
the listening public at the inauguration
of his impressive new theater?

106
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.459
Well, he introduced his Ring Cycle,
which we'll now explore.
