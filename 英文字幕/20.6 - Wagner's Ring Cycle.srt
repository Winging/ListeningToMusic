[MUSIC]

2
00:00:09.664 --> 00:00:13.346
As we have seen,
the era in which Richard Wagner grew up,

3
00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:17.248
in the 19th century,
was a profoundly literary period.

4
00:00:17.248 --> 00:00:21.238
But while Berlioz and
Beethoven was reading Shakespeare,

5
00:00:21.238 --> 00:00:23.930
Wagner was reading Nordic mythology.

6
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.735
Specifically he began to
read Das Niebelungenlied,

7
00:00:27.735 --> 00:00:29.683
the Song of the Nibelungs.

8
00:00:29.683 --> 00:00:36.140
A medieval legend that had been edited and
published in Modern German in the 1820's.

9
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.520
Here is one of the original manuscripts.

10
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.230
One from the early 13th century surviving
in a monastic library in Saint Gallen,

11
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:43.900
Switzerland.

12
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:51.430
And at that very moment that Wagner
was carried away with this fantasy,

13
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.080
this fantasy Nordic literature,

14
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.610
other Nordic literature was being
rediscovered and published.

15
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.290
The Anglo Saxton Beowulf in
the Finnish Kalevala, for example.

16
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.850
Wagner took the story of this legend,
the story of the Nibelungs and

17
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.670
began to craft a libretto for an opera.

18
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.370
Wagner's the only major composer
to have written his own librettos.

19
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.370
So he wrote a libretto, but
then he found he needed to say more.

20
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.780
He needed more explanation, so
he wrote another libretto, a prequel.

21
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.960
And then a prequel to that prequel, and
then another until he had four librettos,

22
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.080
a tetralogy which came to
be called The Ring Cycle.

23
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.650
Here are the four operas
of the Ring Cycle.

24
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.720
Why is it called the Ring Cycle?

25
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.350
Because the story of the Nibelung
turns on the creation, the magic ring,

26
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.700
the possession of which gives
its owner power over the world.

27
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.929
If this all sounds familiar, it is.

28
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:05.920
What we've got here is the beginning
of popular, Nordic fantasy literature.

29
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.098
First in English translations
of the Song of the Nidelungs,

30
00:02:11.098 --> 00:02:15.810
and then in fantasy, elaborations,
as created by J.R.R.

31
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.240
Tolkien, The Lord of the Ring,
CL Lewis, Chronicle of Narnia and

32
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.720
more distantly, George Lucas's Star Wars,
George Martin's Game of Thrones.

33
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.180
Wagner started it all.

34
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.350
What's the plot of Wagner's Ring cycle?

35
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.390
Well, it's complicated.

36
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.310
With Wagner, every thing is
kind of long and complicated.

37
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.870
But to pare this down to 25 words or
less if you will,

38
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.620
there's a chief god, Wotan,
who sees the power-laden ring, and

39
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.960
for a moment he controls the world.

40
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.420
He's fathered many children
with many different wives,

41
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.770
including his favorite his daughter,
the rebellious Brunhilde.

42
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.330
Events require Wotan to punish Brunhilde.

43
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.190
Her punishment is to be
quarantined in a ring of fire.

44
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.170
A ring of fire that only a super hero,
named Siegfried,

45
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.640
only a super hero can penetrate.

46
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.230
Siegfried does this and then he and
Brunhilde go on to further adventures and

47
00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.680
conflicts.

48
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.950
In the end, he's killed by treachery,
and she rides into emulate

49
00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.310
herself in a ring of fire,
a final configuration.

50
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.120
Another instance of a heroine
dying at the end of an opera.

51
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.030
And in this fiery conclusion
the entire world of Wotan and

52
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.260
the gods goes up and down in flames.

53
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.270
To make sense of,
to pull of this together,

54
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:53.020
nearly 17 hours of Opera,
Wagner employed a new technique.

55
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.760
One using what contemporaries call
light motifs, signature motifs.

56
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.270
Musical tags or musical identifiers.

57
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.370
Light motifs are leading motives that
lead the listener through the opera.

58
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.140
Let's listen to a couple of
the many dozens of light motifs

59
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.570
Wagner employs in the ring cycle.

60
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.493
Here are just four,
starting at the beginning,

61
00:04:16.493 --> 00:04:21.380
with the motive representing
the ever flowing Rhine River.

62
00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:31.380
[MUSIC]

63
00:04:37.072 --> 00:04:40.187
Now the motive for the Rhine maidens,

64
00:04:40.187 --> 00:04:46.233
those sub fluvial women who swim beneath
the river Rhine and sing of gold.

65
00:04:46.233 --> 00:04:56.233
[MUSIC]

66
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.590
And now the motive with a curse
associated with the ring.

67
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:14.590
[MUSIC]

68
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.830
And finally,
the motive signaling Valhalla,

69
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.213
that magnificent fortress
home of the gods,

70
00:05:24.213 --> 00:05:28.943
that Wotan has built for
his extended family, and other gods.

71
00:05:28.943 --> 00:05:38.943
[MUSIC]

72
00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:47.813
That's the most sonorous
of the motives and

73
00:05:47.813 --> 00:05:51.379
it's always the job of
the brasses to play it.

74
00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:56.360
Okay, a couple further points, usually
Wagner's light motives are assigned not

75
00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.736
to the singers, but to the orchestra.

76
00:05:58.736 --> 00:06:03.820
Wotan or
Sigfried mentions a sword on stage,

77
00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.020
the sword motive will
mention in the orchestra.

78
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.490
Even if the character says nothing,
the orchestra can still tell us what he or

79
00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:16.160
she is thinking by playing
a light motif in the background.

80
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.500
So Wagner's music can even
penetrate to the subconscious

81
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:25.180
by means of the unseen
orchestra beneath the stage.

82
00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:30.260
Even before the character is aware of it,
we know what he or she is thinking.

83
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.700
Finally, Wagner's notion
of what we call an opera,

84
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.900
well it's not what we usually
think of opera as being.

85
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:46.510
And he didn't like the term, Opera, so
he called his creations Music Dramas.

86
00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:51.590
And the structure of the melody of his
music dramas is very different from that

87
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:56.870
of Italian opera in which is
entirely separately from aria and

88
00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:01.490
that gives us this format
that's called a numbers opera.

89
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.310
Well, Wagner wasn't in
favor of the numbers opera.

90
00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:10.670
He, on the other hand,
wanted Melody that unfolds continually.

91
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:13.740
He called this Endless Melody.

92
00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:20.120
But in truth, it's as much song
declamation as it is melody.

93
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.550
Most of the melody and

94
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:26.470
the dramatic high points of the music
drama, are presented by the orchestra.

95
00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:30.870
The orchestra is hugely important
in Wagner's music dramas,

96
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:34.420
much more so than in various operas.

97
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:38.964
But none of this will make much sense
until we've actually heard much more of

98
00:07:38.964 --> 00:07:39.675
the music.
