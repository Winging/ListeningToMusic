[MUSIC]

2
00:00:13.251 --> 00:00:17.920
We're here today by way of Wagner's music,
is indeed only a teaser.

3
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.890
Only the smallest sample
of his great music.

4
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.910
But I would like to share
with you a bit of video

5
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.450
that my colleague Steve Malinowski and
I, mostly Steve if truth be told,

6
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.970
have created for
Wagner's famous Ride of the Valkyrie.

7
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.834
This is an overture to
the final act of the second

8
00:00:38.834 --> 00:00:43.460
music drama of the Ring Cycle,
Die Walkure.

9
00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.520
Here the women warriors,
the Valkyries, ride up from

10
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.070
a battlefield toward Valhalla carrying
the bodies of fallen heroes in battle.

11
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.720
This is the music, in instrumental form,

12
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.810
that precedes the next
scene that we'll see.

13
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.030
This is the music that opens the third and
final act of Die Walkure.

14
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.485
You'll recognize this music and
I'll comment as we go.

15
00:01:10.485 --> 00:01:12.912
We start out here in trills,

16
00:01:12.912 --> 00:01:14.350
[MUSIC]

17
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.546
You see woodwinds

18
00:01:15.546 --> 00:01:16.371
[MUSIC]

19
00:01:16.371 --> 00:01:22.140
And each time a new one enters,
it's up or down an up or down an octave.

20
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.326
A rhythmic mobic is now started out.

21
00:01:29.326 --> 00:01:34.387
[MUSIC]

22
00:01:34.387 --> 00:01:39.315
Now, of course, the theme

23
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:50.820
[MUSIC]

24
00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:05.977
Minor

25
00:02:05.977 --> 00:02:16.563
[MUSIC]

26
00:02:16.563 --> 00:02:18.235
Transition to major.

27
00:02:18.235 --> 00:02:26.640
[MUSIC]

28
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.834
More low brass enters.

29
00:02:28.834 --> 00:02:34.243
More trombone and
tuba as the texture builds.

30
00:02:34.243 --> 00:02:40.442
[MUSIC]

31
00:02:40.442 --> 00:02:44.202
Now this part, Wagner's original,

32
00:02:44.202 --> 00:02:48.674
he wrote this as
an instrumental [INAUDIBLE].

33
00:02:48.674 --> 00:02:51.571
[INAUDIBLE] been some,

34
00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:56.452
Valkyries with their cries up above.

35
00:02:56.452 --> 00:03:01.187
Here they are, swinging through
the air on Wagner's stage and

36
00:03:01.187 --> 00:03:03.521
singing cries to one another.

37
00:03:03.521 --> 00:03:09.976
[MUSIC]

38
00:03:09.976 --> 00:03:12.578
Once again the theme comes back,
a light motif.

39
00:03:12.578 --> 00:03:13.878
[MUSIC]

40
00:03:13.878 --> 00:03:15.236
With the brass reappearing in there.

41
00:03:15.236 --> 00:03:25.236
[MUSIC]

42
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.706
He'd hold the tubas there,
we worked to that climax and

43
00:03:43.706 --> 00:03:45.570
we're going to fade it out here.

44
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:46.595
We're actually half way through
this exciting, driving overture.

45
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.040
But let's move on.

46
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.160
Eventually Valkyrie Brunhilde
meets up with her father, Wotan.

47
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.850
He must punish her for suborning incest.

48
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.850
We needn't go in to the specifics of that.

49
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.851
To inflict the punishment as said,

50
00:04:07.851 --> 00:04:10.729
Wotan will surround Brunhilde
with a ring of fire.

51
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.970
Wotan knows that he is sacrificing.

52
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:20.750
We'll never see again his beloved child,
his most favored of all children.

53
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.100
But the social order of the world,
Wotan's world, requires that this be so.

54
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.160
As we've seen, everything with Wagner is
complicated, so I've tried to simplify and

55
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.270
explain this climactic scene as we

56
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.670
view it in a production from
the Metropolitan Opera performance.

57
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:47.100
I tried to provide a guide here
with a synopsis of the drama.

58
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.250
And I'm shortening the text admittedly.

59
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:55.016
And I tried to provide
an identification of the light motifs

60
00:04:55.016 --> 00:04:57.305
as we proceed through this.

61
00:04:57.305 --> 00:05:02.439
Here as we see Wotan say
goodbye to Brunhilde,

62
00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:05.606
here in Wotan's farewell.

63
00:05:05.606 --> 00:05:15.606

[MUSIC]

70
00:09:50.927 --> 00:09:58.413
Then gradually diminishes,
rises by a pitch, and continues.

71
00:09:58.413 --> 00:10:01.820
Well, that's extraordinary,
that's extraordinary.

72
00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:06.708
What Wagner had really foreseen here,
I believe, is what we would call today,

73
00:10:06.708 --> 00:10:08.830
an IMAX theater.

74
00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:11.730
Sitting in a darkness
with an unseen orchestra,

75
00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:16.340
completely surrounded by sound and

76
00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:21.870
completely enveloped in the drama
that's unfolding before us.

77
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:27.621
As I say, as the most original,
most transformative force in the history

78
00:10:27.621 --> 00:10:32.560
of Western theatre,
it's difficult to deny Richard Wagner.
