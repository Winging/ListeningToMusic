2
00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:26.659
Let's begin our session on the romantic
orchestra with a quick review quiz.

3
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.980
I'd like to play two pieces for you,
have you listen and tell me which is from

4
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.050
the 18th century, the classical period,
and which from the 19th, the romantic era.

5
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.250
Most important,

6
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.710
let's think about what it is that you
hear that leads you to this conclusion.

7
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.941
Let's hear the first clip.

8
00:00:48.941 --> 00:00:58.941
[MUSIC]

9
00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.563
Okay, and now the second clip.

10
00:01:28.563 --> 00:01:38.563
[MUSIC]

11
00:02:07.582 --> 00:02:11.744
All right, I hope you agree that the first
is from the classical period, and

12
00:02:11.744 --> 00:02:14.310
the second from the romantic period.

13
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.630
A symphony of Mozart,
the Linz Symphony, and

14
00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.160
an overture by Richard Wagner,
Overture to the Flying Dutchman.

15
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.005
Let's dig down a little bit deeper
here and pursue the classical model.

16
00:02:25.005 --> 00:02:29.045
You can just read my evaluation
of the music as it plays.

17
00:02:29.045 --> 00:02:39.045
[MUSIC]

18
00:03:19.243 --> 00:03:23.047
All right, and now the romantic
paradigm with a famous passage from

19
00:03:23.047 --> 00:03:25.300
Tchaikovsky's Romeo and Juliet.

20
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.638
And again, you'll see my synopsis.

21
00:03:27.638 --> 00:03:37.638
[MUSIC]

22
00:04:08.225 --> 00:04:12.720
Let's compare now the size of
the orchestras that created this music.

23
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.930
In the Mozart classical orchestra,

24
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.260
there were roughly 30 to 35 players,
as you can see here.

25
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.230
To the left, we have first violin,
second violins on the right,

26
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.680
some violas here, three cellos,
two double basses and pairs of woodwinds.

27
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.205
No trombones, for example.

28
00:04:33.205 --> 00:04:36.050
Slight on the brasses, and

29
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.600
this was a rather large
orchestra by Mozart's standards.

30
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.810
Okay, here's the seating chart that
might typify the orchestra for

31
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.470
the Tchaikovsky that we just heard.

32
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.550
Many more brasses and woodwinds, and
to balance them, more strings are needed.

33
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:58.220
And down at the bottom, of course,
you can see this person, the conductor.

34
00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.150
When did we get a conductor for
the western symphony orchestra?

35
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.080
Was it with Mozart?

36
00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.260
So here we have Mozart, or
the actor playing Mozart,

37
00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.960
conducting in the remarkable film Amadeus.

38
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.730
But the scene, while dramatic,
is not historically correct.

39
00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:22.240
Mozart conducted seated at a keyboard
instrument, usually the early piano forte.

40
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.400
So when did conductors start to
stand up and wave their arms around?

41
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:33.920
Well, oddly enough in the mid-19th
century, the same time that urban centers,

42
00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.550
especially London, got crowded
with vehicles on the street and

43
00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.780
a traffic cop appeared,
waving a stick or a lantern at night.

44
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.746
Here are silhouettes of one of
the first standing conductors,

45
00:05:46.746 --> 00:05:52.580
the composer conductor Carl Maria von
Weber, a distant relative of Mozart.

46
00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:59.770
Here's Liszt conducting a large orchestra
in Budapest late in his career.

47
00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.590
Liszt directs all, a God-like figure.

48
00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:10.340
And here are two silhouettes of
Wagner conducting in his late career.

49
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.110
Maybe the most remarkable
image of this sort however,

50
00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.020
is a concert in Covent Garden.

51
00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.480
In the center of London,
1846, published that year,

52
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.010
this engraving, published that
year in the London Daily Mail.

53
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.570
You see the conductor.

54
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:28.110
See if I can point to the conductor.

55
00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:33.110
There he is standing in the middle
of a massive orchestra.

56
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.170
The strings are to the front of him.

57
00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:42.530
The woodwinds are in risers
up to the back here.

58
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.500
And then further back,
we have the percussion tympani, and

59
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.150
then even more tympani and brasses, and

60
00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:54.540
that gigantic bass drum all the way at the
back, as you can see up here at the top.

61
00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:00.840
So the 19th century orchestra was getting
larger and larger, and louder and louder.

62
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.530
Think about it for a moment.

63
00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:08.360
What was the largest man-made
sound that a citizen of the 19th

64
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:14.210
century would've experienced before
the electronic amplification of sound?

65
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:19.260
Only two things were louder than
the full symphony orchestra,

66
00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.780
the steam engine and the cannon.

67
00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:26.280
The symphony orchestra was next in line,
however, in volume.

68
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.220
The notion of the fire power

69
00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:33.140
of the 19th century orchestra was not
lost on the listeners of the day.

70
00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:36.865
As we see in this 19th
century satirical drawing,

71
00:07:36.865 --> 00:07:41.871
this cartoon of Hector Berlioz
conducting the firing of the brasses.

72
00:07:41.871 --> 00:07:51.871
[MUSIC]

73
00:08:11.196 --> 00:08:12.820
Pretty impressive.

74
00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:16.660
Within a mere 40 years,
from Mozart to Berlioz,

75
00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.480
the sound of the orchestra
had increased enormously.

76
00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.280
What was driving this change?

77
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:27.670
What has driven every important change
in the west in the last 300 years?

78
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:29.298
Technology.
