2
00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:17.732
When we enjoyed the music of Beethoven,
specifically his Symphony No 5,

3
00:00:17.732 --> 00:00:22.698
and the music of Berlioz, specially,
his Symphonie fantastique,

4
00:00:22.698 --> 00:00:26.979
we saw how these innovative
creators increased the size and

5
00:00:26.979 --> 00:00:29.730
the color of the symphony orchestra.

6
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.550
Here's a review question.

7
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.680
What three new instruments did Beethoven
bring into the symphony orchestra?

8
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.535
Put your thinking caps on now.

9
00:00:42.435 --> 00:00:43.370
Good.

10
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.350
Contrabassoon, trombone, and piccolo.

11
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.450
And what about Berlioz?

12
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.598
What instruments did he introduce?

13
00:00:53.896 --> 00:00:55.496
Good again.

14
00:00:55.496 --> 00:00:58.040
Tuba, harp and cornet.

15
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.110
And the English horn, well,
we'll get to that in just a moment.

16
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.000
As you can see by this
comparison of instruments,

17
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.900
from the 18th century on the left, and
those of the 19th century on the right,

18
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.210
we see how technology
improved the flexibility.

19
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.010
Well, they could play
more pitches in tune.

20
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.670
And their facility,

21
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.580
they could play the pitches a lot faster
because of the introduction of valves and

22
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.620
new keypad extenders, here for the flute,
the french horn, and the trumpet.

23
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.470
Indeed, up to this time,
the horn was just called corno, horn.

24
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.815
Now it's called the french horn
because it has these fancy new valves.

25
00:01:40.815 --> 00:01:44.800
Now here's a fascinating image: a factory

26
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.050
with assembly line production
during the Industrial Revolution.

27
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.330
And it's huge.

28
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.620
It was the factory of
Adolphe Sax in Paris.

29
00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.547
He, of course,
was the inventor of the saxophone.

30
00:02:00.547 --> 00:02:04.565
Notice [LAUGH] first the production
assembly line with the smallest parts

31
00:02:04.565 --> 00:02:08.505
being assembled on the left and gradually
the instruments would be assembled and

32
00:02:08.505 --> 00:02:11.965
grow in size as we move
around to the right.

33
00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:16.145
Notice in his shop,
these manufacturing saxophones of course.

34
00:02:16.145 --> 00:02:18.595
We see a giant one
hanging from the ceiling,

35
00:02:18.595 --> 00:02:22.040
the roof there, at the arrow on the top.

36
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.100
But also,
he was manufacturing trumpets and tubas.

37
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.350
Notice the tubas are visible
at two lower arrows there.

38
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.420
They really do look like, if you look
closely, they really do look like cannons.

39
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.805
And here we see these low brasses as they
look today in a recording studio session.

40
00:02:42.805 --> 00:02:47.039
Note especially the trombones and
the tubas.

41
00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:57.039
[MUSIC]

42
00:03:16.328 --> 00:03:20.836
And Hector Berlioz added one other
instrument to the orchestra, and

43
00:03:20.836 --> 00:03:22.630
that was the English horn.

44
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.770
Ironically, of course,

45
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:30.010
the English horn is neither a horn, it's
not a brass instrument, nor is it English.

46
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.270
It's a woodwind instrument,
a low oboe of French origin.

47
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.310
But it does have a particular
sound that we think of as being,

48
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.470
well maybe perhaps mournful, or
melancholy, or even nostalgic.

49
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.440
Let's listen to what might seem to
be the melancholy, or nostalgic

50
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:54.320
quality of the English horn with an image
of the American Midwest in the background.

51
00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.036
The composer, Dvorak,
wrote some of this symphony while residing

52
00:03:59.036 --> 00:04:03.929
in the Midwestern state of Iowa,
in Spillville, Iowa to be precise.

53
00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:13.929
[MUSIC]

54
00:05:05.238 --> 00:05:09.913
And while all of these woodwinds and
brasses were being added to the orchestra,

55
00:05:09.913 --> 00:05:14.870
to balance them more strings were needed,
and a bigger string sound.

56
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.870
The string instruments themselves,
they didn't get bigger, but

57
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.960
how they were constructed did change.

58
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.650
Let's look at the slide of a violin here.

59
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:29.610
First of all, notice with the Baroque
violin that the finger board on the left

60
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:36.770
is on the same plane, same flat plane,
as the body of the instrument.

61
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.560
But on the top, with the modern violin,
the fingerboard is at an angle.

62
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.110
And that requires a higher bridge
which lifts the strings away from

63
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.740
the instrument, allowing the player
to dig in more with the bow.

64
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:55.070
And then, there's the bow itself,
it's gotten larger in the 19th century.

65
00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:59.090
And the horse hair would make up
the sounding part of the bow, well,

66
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.780
that has gotten wider and
the steel rod is placed inside,

67
00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:09.700
that makes it possible to tighten the bow
and increase pressure on the strings.

68
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:15.450
And the strings of the instrument
were now uniformly made of wire,

69
00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:21.020
no longer animal gut, gut of sheep,
or animal gut of cat, cat gut.

70
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.770
That's why kitty is smiling
here at these new, or

71
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.860
newly reconstructed instruments that
allow for more power and color.

72
00:06:30.875 --> 00:06:36.021
All right, with the newly enlarged
orchestra in place let's see how,

73
00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:40.154
as the orchestra got bigger,
musical time slowed down.
