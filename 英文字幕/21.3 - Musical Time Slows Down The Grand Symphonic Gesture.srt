[MUSIC]

2
00:00:12.847 --> 00:00:17.760
Get a sense of what I mean by
the statement musical time slowed down.

3
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.080
Let's review standard operating
procedure for the classical period.

4
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.990
Let's listen again to
Eine Kleine Nachtmusik with an ear for

5
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.100
the rate at which the musical
ideas are presented.

6
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.850
I'll count the ideas as we go.

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.120
Five.

13
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.661
[MUSIC]

14
00:00:59.661 --> 00:01:00.850
All right.

15
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.070
We've heard five distinctly different
musical ideas in about 25 seconds,

16
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.590
roughly one every five seconds.

17
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.900
Why did Mozart need so many musical
motives in such a short space?

18
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.883
Because he didn't have a big, rich sound.

19
00:01:15.883 --> 00:01:17.543
He had only a small piano.

20
00:01:17.543 --> 00:01:20.178
as we've seen before,
and a small orchestra.
