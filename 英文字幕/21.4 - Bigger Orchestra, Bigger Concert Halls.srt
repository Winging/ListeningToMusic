[MUSIC]

2
00:00:11.895 --> 00:00:16.107
As you might suspect,
with the orchestra growing ever larger,

3
00:00:16.107 --> 00:00:21.150
producing an ever larger sound,
concert halls got larger as well.

4
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.220
And they changed in function,
or in purpose too.

5
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.998
Here again we go back to Vienna and
Beethoven's day.

6
00:00:27.998 --> 00:00:29.793
The Theater an der Wien,

7
00:00:29.793 --> 00:00:35.101
where Beethoven premiered his famous
Symphony Number Five in 1808.

8
00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:38.700
This image dates from only
about two years later.

9
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.960
Here we can see draped
in red bunting here,

10
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.120
the imperial box with
a double headed eagle.

11
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.190
Down here to the left, up next to the
stage is the orchestra with the musicians

12
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.910
and on the stage here to the bottom
lower left what do we see?

13
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.243
Horses!

14
00:01:00.243 --> 00:01:04.661
This was a civic auditorium,
an entertainment center,

15
00:01:04.661 --> 00:01:10.190
almost as in a Las Vegas auditorium or
Radio City Music Hall in New York.

16
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.750
But after Beethoven's death,
two things happened.

17
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.420
First, some of Beethoven's admirers in
Vienna built a music only concert hall,

18
00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.950
the beautiful Music Society Hall,
the Musikverein, as it's called in Vienna.

19
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.780
Here, just music.

20
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.070
No circus acts.

21
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.170
On this stage, Johannes Brahms conducted.

22
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.240
So too, did Gustav Mahler,
whose music we'll hear shortly.

23
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.990
And 2, and this is the second point,

24
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.010
sudden hush came over the concert hall and
it's listeners.

25
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:56.500
The idea of a quiet,
quiet only concert hall enters now.

26
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.050
Music was no longer thought
of to be entertainment, but

27
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.260
it had become in the romantic era,
high art.

28
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.360
Art that was to be heard
in reverential silence.

29
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.390
And this new temple to the God of
Music came to be replicated elsewhere.

30
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.100
First in Liepzig, Germany and
then in the United States.

31
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.130
Now admittedly Carnegie Hall in New York,

32
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.310
that's the first great
American concert hall.

33
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.290
And it was a little bit different.

34
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.900
It does have a circular model.

35
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.101
But, the symphony hall in Boston is almost

36
00:02:32.101 --> 00:02:37.457
an exact reproduction of the Musikverein.

37
00:02:37.457 --> 00:02:41.498
As you see here in this sort of
shoebox effect is drawn again

38
00:02:41.498 --> 00:02:43.180
from the Musikverein.

39
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.060
And here let's go to Woolsey Hall,
At Yale University in New Haven,

40
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.430
again, this sort of shoe box design.

41
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.370
It has many similarities with
the Musikverein in Vienna.

42
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.717
And even in modern times the Vienna
prototype has been adopted,

43
00:02:59.717 --> 00:03:01.890
Avery Fisher Hall in New York and

44
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.258
most recently at the Schermerhorn
Symphony Hall in Nashville.

45
00:03:06.258 --> 00:03:11.761
So, this is the Schermerhorn Symphony Hall
in Nashville.

46
00:03:11.761 --> 00:03:16.210
But it all started in Vienna,
with the Musikverein.

47
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.750
With sounds, such as those produced by,

48
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.980
as you will hear here,
symphonic composer Jean Sibelius.

49
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.664
Great music and great acoustics for music.

50
00:03:27.664 --> 00:03:37.664
[MUSIC]

51
00:03:55.561 --> 00:04:00.144
So these ever larger concert halls for
music only, of the late 19th and early

52
00:04:00.144 --> 00:04:06.220
20th centuries, well they were not only
visually stunning, but acoustical marvels.

53
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:12.629
And in many ways, they were the finest
concert halls for music ever created,

54
00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:17.278
home to the largest symphony
orchestras ever created.
