[MUSIC]

2
00:00:28.879 --> 00:00:31.710
The music we just heard
on the opening slide

3
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.130
is a little more music
than we usually hear.

4
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.550
It's some of the beautiful adagietto
of Gustav Mahler's Symphony Number 5.

5
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.340
And Mahler conducted, as we mentioned, on
the stage of the Music Variety in Vienna.

6
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.780
He conducted the Vienna Philharmonic
from 1898 until 1907 and

7
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.820
then he came to New York.

8
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.890
So although Mahler,
like his contemporary, Sigmund Freud,

9
00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.980
was born in the Czech Republic,
he made the core of his career in Vienna.

10
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.910
Mahler was both a conductor and
a composer.

11
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.700
He conducted during the winter months and
he composed during the summers.

12
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.710
Most of what he composed
falls into two categories.

13
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:18.580
First, songs accompanied by an orchestra,
a genre that we call the orchestral lead.

14
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.810
And then, symphonies,
nine complete symphonies in all.

15
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.410
But unique to Mahler was his
urge to incorporate songs or

16
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.540
music from songs into his symphonic works.

17
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.080
As you can see, in all but
two of his symphonies,

18
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.460
previously composed vocal
music played a role.

19
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.980
Let's see what some of these
symphonies sound like, let's take for

20
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.830
example the end of
Mahler's first symphony.

21
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.530
Which shows us again the extent of
the power of the late romantic symphony

22
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:51.530
orchestra.

23
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.320
The conductor here is the young
Venezuelan Gustavo Dudamel leading

24
00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.180
the Los Angeles Philharmonic.

25
00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.110
What do you think of his
style of conducting here?

26
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.530
Do you like it or not?

27
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.513
I'll comment about the performance as
we go though the music pretty much says

28
00:02:08.513 --> 00:02:09.058
it all.

29
00:02:09.058 --> 00:02:19.058
[MUSIC]

30
00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:43.685
Rising motif, then the trumpets.

[MUSIC]

32
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.475
Mostly by step.

33

[MUSIC]

34
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.514
Standing motif, mostly by step.

35
00:02:59.514 --> 00:03:01.638
Tremolo, you saw there in the screen.

36
00:03:01.638 --> 00:03:06.767
[MUSIC]

37
00:03:06.767 --> 00:03:10.222
Descending motif using
interval of a fourth.

38
00:03:10.222 --> 00:03:15.038
[MUSIC]

39
00:03:15.038 --> 00:03:20.138
A little bit of literally grand standing
on the part of the French hornsmen.

40
00:03:20.138 --> 00:03:22.846
The accompaniment,
looks like at least six people.

41
00:03:22.846 --> 00:03:25.842
[MUSIC]

42
00:03:25.842 --> 00:03:27.966
The tempo rubato as it flows down.

43
00:03:27.966 --> 00:03:32.015
[MUSIC]

44
00:03:32.015 --> 00:03:34.345
Drums going down,
[INAUDIBLE] motifs going up.

45
00:03:34.345 --> 00:03:40.266
[MUSIC]

46
00:03:40.266 --> 00:03:42.470
Notice he's conducting without a score.

47
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.136
[MUSIC]

48
00:03:45.136 --> 00:03:47.685
Notice also we have two tympany here.

49
00:03:47.685 --> 00:03:54.886
Horn, the semi-motif, now the ascending
motif will come in with it, counterpoint.

50
00:03:54.886 --> 00:03:55.850
Double counterpoint.

51
00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:05.048
[MUSIC]

52
00:04:05.048 --> 00:04:07.346

[MUSIC]

54
00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:24.307
And this is all, [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:24.307 --> 00:04:34.307
[MUSIC]

56
00:04:39.887 --> 00:04:43.456
>> [APPLAUSE]
>> Okay, well obviously,

57
00:04:43.456 --> 00:04:47.200
we've come a long way
since the sound of Mozart.

58
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.600
In less than a century and

59
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.000
it's the orchestra that's carrying
the day here in Mahler's Symphony.

60
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.557
And what did you think of the conductor,
Dudamel?

61
00:04:55.557 --> 00:05:02.681
Do you feel that a conductor in moving
can help the listener, can help us?

62
00:05:02.681 --> 00:05:05.420
Enjoy the piece more,
get into the piece more, or

63
00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.880
do you find that kind of
conducting to be a distraction?

64
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.500
I like that approach.

65
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.780
It's more likely to get you,
the audience and me, energized and

66
00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.540
emotionally engaged with the performance.

67
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.390
If you like that Mahler and
wanna hear more, here's a suggestion.

68
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:26.710
For the listener, Gustav Mahler is
often a challenging composer and

69
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.970
his symphonies are long.

70
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:33.430
And sometimes diffuse,
something of a labyrinth.

71
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.510
But there's a logical path
through this labyrinth of Mahler.

72
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.790
If you start with the more
easily accessible symphonies and

73
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.770
move out from there.

74
00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.650
Here's what I'd recommend,
a path to follow.

75
00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.860
I'd start, well, with Symphony Number 1.

76
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.140
The Titan as it's called and
we heard a bit of the end of that.

77
00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:58.360
Then I'd go onto Symphony number four,
particularly the fourth movement there,

78
00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.020
the finale that has some beautiful vocal
music sung by a soprano as part of it.

79
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.540
Then I'd go on to what we heard at
the opening slide of this segment,

80
00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.000
the beautiful adagietto
of the fifth symphony.

81
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.150
Then the spectacular Symphony of
a Thousand, the eighth symphony and so on.

82
00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:21.337
You can see chronologically that
these all range from 1888 to 1910.

83
00:06:21.337 --> 00:06:25.312
But I'd like to end our brief
sample of the symphonies of Mahler

84
00:06:25.312 --> 00:06:27.640
with a piece that isn't a symphony.

85
00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:34.130
Remember we said, Mahler would usually
compose an orchestral song first and

86
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.040
then, in one way or another.

87
00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.420
Bring some of that music into a new
symphony that he was creating.

88
00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.820
So here's the song,
Ich bin der Welt abhanden gekommen,

89
00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.630
I'm lost to the world,
I've become detached from the world.

90
00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:52.020
Parts of which he later used
in his Symphony Number 5.

91
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:56.550
The song was written in 1901 and
it was one of the set of five

92
00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:01.040
composed on text by the German poet,
Friedrich RÃ¼ckert.

93
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:06.927
So what you're about to hear then again,
is an orchestral song, an orchestral lead.

94
00:07:06.927 --> 00:07:12.350
The text is a melancholy one, indeed,
Mahler was a melancholy person.

95
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:15.120
A melancholy Mahler if you will.

96
00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:19.120
Here both poet and
composer express isolation,

97
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:24.670
solitude, distance, a sense of the past,
perhaps a lost past.

98
00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:30.320
But ultimately, a certain resolution
indeed, certain satisfaction,

99
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:36.670
solace, that music can provide
a refuge for each human being.

100
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:43.810
As the text that the inn says, I'd escaped
into my solitary world of love and music.

101
00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:49.285
A love for music,
in [FOREIGN], in [FOREIGN].

102
00:07:49.285 --> 00:07:56.370
In my love and in my song, my music song
here being a metaphor for all music.

103
00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:02.150
Let's listen to this
exquisitely beautiful piece as

104
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:07.351
conducted by Claudio Abbado and
sung by Magdalena Kozena.

105
00:08:07.351 --> 00:08:17.351
[MUSIC]

106
00:14:38.639 --> 00:14:43.573
Purpose of music, indeed of all art,
is nothing less and to search for

107
00:14:43.573 --> 00:14:46.342
an explanation of the meaning of life.

108
00:14:46.342 --> 00:14:51.374
And to create a medium for
reengaging all of the sensations and

109
00:14:51.374 --> 00:14:53.421
sensibilities of life.

110
00:14:53.421 --> 00:14:58.549
But one thing I don't understand
is one of the mysteries of life.

111
00:14:58.549 --> 00:15:00.140
How does someone hear?

112
00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:04.790
How does someone create sounds like
that simply inside one's head?

113
00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:08.340
Alas, I have no idea.

114
00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:09.766
It's simply a gift.
