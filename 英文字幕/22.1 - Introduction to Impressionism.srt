[MUSIC]

2
00:00:22.096 --> 00:00:26.471
Today we leave the music of
the romantic period, and German orbit,

3
00:00:26.471 --> 00:00:31.990
and return to France and engage
impressionism, impressionism in art.

4
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.400
And who doesn't like the viewer
friendly style of French Impressionism?

5
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.870
As we see in this
painting by Claude Monet.

6
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.830
But I'd like to move back a bit
to two other paintings that show

7
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:52.290
no matter how benign impressionism
seems today, at the time

8
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.740
it was a radical turning away from
established art, the art of the academy.

9
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.290
And to make this point,
let's look at the kind of paintings

10
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.865
that you would then see in the Louvre,
and indeed, this one's still there today.

11
00:01:04.865 --> 00:01:10.553
It's by Jean Auguste Ingres, and it's a
portrait of the composer Luigi Cherubini,

12
00:01:10.553 --> 00:01:14.680
Berlioz's teacher at
the Paris Conservatory.

13
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.360
Notice the classical lines and

14
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:23.010
the classical imagery with the muse of the
music and the liar behind the composer.

15
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.390
This is the sort of officially
sanctioned art that the Parisian

16
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.480
public expected at that time.

17
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.140
The type of art that would
have been taught and

18
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.592
exhibited at the Ã‰cole des Beaux-Arts.

19
00:01:34.592 --> 00:01:38.522
The fine arts school,
the official showing place of the academy,

20
00:01:38.522 --> 00:01:41.900
the academy of art on
the left bank of Paris.

21
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.520
Then and now, official art.

22
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.920
Now, here's another example,
the official, very realistic art,

23
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.860
then in favor at the Academy in
the second half of the 19th century.

24
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.100
Notice how carefully
the figures are executed.

25
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.820
This painting is so
realistic it's almost like a photograph.

26
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.980
But next,
a radically different approach to art.

27
00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.940
Impressionist at Sunrise.

28
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.380
Or An Impression of Sunrise on the
Thames River in London by Claude Monet.

29
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.770
Can you make sense out of,
can you see a sun?

30
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.560
Well, yes,
I can see a sun there pretty clearly.

31
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.610
A city and boats, well, maybe.

32
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.600
I guess, I see the boats there.

33
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.430
But the rest of this is
pretty much just a haze,

34
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.100
an impression of what
a sunrise might have been.

35
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.300
Now in 1874, Monet asked to

36
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.016
have this paint exhibited at the Salon
of the Academy of Fine Arts.

37
00:02:43.016 --> 00:02:47.810
Monet's painting was rejected.

38
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.256
Said one art critic at the time quote,

39
00:02:50.256 --> 00:02:55.100
wallpaper in its more,em,
most embryonic state.

40
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.770
Wallpaper in its most embryonic state

41
00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.500
is more finished than this seascape,
end quote.

42
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.660
But this was the painting
that started it all.

43
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.610
The Impressionist movement.

44
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.070
Monet and his friend Renoir and

45
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:15.270
other kindred spirits were derisively
referred to as Impressionists.

46
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.860
And the label stuck.

47
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.270
Their paintings did not
offer photographic realism,

48
00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.760
a photo-like reproduction of a subject or
a scene but

49
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.750
rather a sensation of it,
a momentary fleeting feeling of it.

50
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.460
More mood than realism.

51
00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:32.500
Here's another example.

52
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.550
One of my favorites called
A Portrait of a Woman with Umbrella.

53
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.230
But its less a portrait of a woman
than it is a sensation of some

54
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.640
bright spring day with its sunlight and
its fresh air and its invigorating breeze.

55
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.370
Impression of an experience.

56
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.970
Oddly, this kind of painting,
which was initially rejected and

57
00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.310
despised by the academy,
became, over time,

58
00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:05.800
the most publicly popular of all
styles of painting, all styles of art.

59
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.870
If your local museum needs
to raise some money,

60
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.740
just put on an exhibition
of impressionism.

61
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.450
It will be a block buster, and
the public will come flocking in.

62
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.642
Another quick example.

63
00:04:17.642 --> 00:04:21.825
Here we see, Monet's La Grenouilliere,
The Frog Pond.

64
00:04:21.825 --> 00:04:26.440
We sense the shimmering of
the water seen from a distance.

65
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.258
But as we approach the painting, we see
how this sensation, this impression,

66
00:04:31.258 --> 00:04:37.480
is effective or brought on by Monet
through individual dabs of color.

67
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.740
Individual dabs close up,
but an overall sensation or

68
00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.760
impression experienced as the viewer
will experience it from a distance.

69
00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.150
Individual dabs of color
produce this shimmering effect.

70
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.010
And that's what we'll be talking
about today, color and music and

71
00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.320
how music is broken down
into dabs of sound.

72
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.350
Rather than tied to one long,
one color melody.

73
00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.170
As we move from romanticism to modernism
in the arts, especially music,

74
00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:14.840
melody is being broken down and
color and texture are being foreground.

75
00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:21.569
Now, the seminal figure in this transition
for music is the composer Claude Debussy.

76
00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:29.072
Exemplified by a shimmering moment from
his Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun.

77
00:05:29.072 --> 00:05:39.072
[MUSIC]

78
00:05:44.653 --> 00:05:47.322
Well, that's a very
different kind of sound.

79
00:05:47.322 --> 00:05:49.768
One very different than
what we've been hearing and

80
00:05:49.768 --> 00:05:52.840
what we've been experiencing
with romantic music.

81
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.300
But who were these Impressionists?

82
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.450
Well, here we have a list.

83
00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:01.940
A list of Painters on the left, Manet,
Monet, Renoir, Sisley, Pissaro, Cassatt.

84
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.300
And they are sort of precursor
of the Impressionists.

85
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.370
And then the symbolist Poets, of course,
Baudelaire, Verlaine, Rimbaud, Mallarme.

86
00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.160
We'll be talking a bit
more about them later on.

87
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.640
And then the Composers,
Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, and

88
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:22.130
perhaps principle to, but also Gabriel
Faure, the Italian, Ottorino Respighi,

89
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.100
and the American, Charles Griffes, and
while we're on the subject of Americans,

90
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.740
let's not forget over there to
left at the bottom, of the pa,

91
00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:34.150
the painters, the American woman painter,
Mary Cassatt.

92
00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:42.370
To see this transition from romanticism to
impressionism in context let's contrast

93
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:48.140
the French Impressionists with
the mainline of German Composers.

94
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:52.100
With the Germans of course we have Bach
and Handel and the incomparable Haydn and

95
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.060
Mozart and so
on down through Gustav Mahler.

96
00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.230
And note that although Tchaikovsky and
Dvorak, well,

97
00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:03.630
well they were in fact Russian and Czech.

98
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:08.250
Of course they composed generally in
this dominant, mainline German style.

99
00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:12.840
Okay, well,
how did a German tradition differ

100
00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.549
from the one that emerged in
France in the late 19th century.

101
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:22.240
Well, as you can see here over on the
left, the Germans preferred symphonies and

102
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.320
concertos, while the French composers were
more inclined to engage in tone poems,

103
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.200
as we described them before.

104
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.570
So the Germans tended to
prefer narrative music.

105
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:34.534
The French mood music.

106
00:07:34.534 --> 00:07:38.154
The German's tended to write
music that was goal oriented.

107
00:07:38.154 --> 00:07:42.540
And what I mean by that was not only for
te, theological from beginning to end but

108
00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:45.240
it was based on cord progressions.

109
00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:49.375
Here would be a typical chord
progression in a German tradition.

110
00:07:49.375 --> 00:07:58.535
>> [MUSIC]

111
00:07:58.535 --> 00:08:02.366
Whereas the French might prefer music that

112
00:08:02.366 --> 00:08:06.684
harmonically is far more static,
static, static.

113
00:08:06.684 --> 00:08:10.086
And engage it so by means of ostinato.

114
00:08:10.086 --> 00:08:20.221
[MUSIC]

115
00:08:20.221 --> 00:08:22.822
It's repeating over and over again.

116
00:08:22.822 --> 00:08:23.830
An ostinato pattern there.

117
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:28.390
Contrary motion as opposed
to parallel motion.

118
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:32.930
This contrary motion is, we will see with
just a moment, is a German specialty,

119
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:36.430
parody motion, is something
the French introduce at this point.

120
00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:37.660
Major and minor scales.

121
00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:40.030
Well they've been the basis
of all Western music.

122
00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:42.410
Since we began talking about it.

123
00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:45.750
Really from the 16th century on,
as opposed to new scales,

124
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:47.300
we'll experience today.

125
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.020
The whole tone scale.

126
00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:51.530
And the pen, pentatonic scale.

127
00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:54.040
But just to exemplify this
now through the music,

128
00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.390
let's turn to an example by Gustav Mahler.

129
00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:02.144
We'll hear a bit of the symphony of
Gustav Mahler, his first symphony.

130
00:09:02.144 --> 00:09:12.144
[MUSIC]

131
00:09:23.305 --> 00:09:24.800
Okay, so that was Mahler.

132
00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:30.198
Now Debussy, just six years later.

133
00:09:30.198 --> 00:09:40.198
[MUSIC]

134
00:10:08.575 --> 00:10:13.443
As I say, the German style seems to march
along goal oriented through functional

135
00:10:13.443 --> 00:10:15.330
chord progression.

136
00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:19.030
The French style, on the other hand,
seems to be perfectly content

137
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:24.690
to live with the moment, to languish and
enjoy the musical mood of the moment.

138
00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:27.704
Let's go on now to meet the principle com,

139
00:10:27.704 --> 00:10:31.570
proponent of Impressionist music,
Claude Debussy.
