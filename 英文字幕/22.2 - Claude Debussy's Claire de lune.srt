[MUSIC]

2
00:00:15.892 --> 00:00:21.300
To be direct, the biography of
Claude Debussy isn't very interesting.

3
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.590
He didn't have 19 children like Bach.

4
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.390
He didn't overcome a disability
like Beethoven and

5
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.340
he didn't possess the eccentric
brilliance of Mozart.

6
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.320
So let's just say that Debussy was
born in the area of Paris in 1862,

7
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.990
was educated at the Paris Conservatory,
and

8
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.310
died in Paris toward the end of
the First World War in 1918.

9
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:45.040
But he did write great music,
a bit of which you just heard.

10
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.625
I'd like to focus this
segment on just one piece,

11
00:00:49.625 --> 00:00:54.529
Debussy's famous Clair de Lune,
Moonlight, written in 1890.

12
00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:57.632
It's something of a bridge
between romanticism and

13
00:00:57.632 --> 00:01:00.930
hard core impressionism, a middle ground.

14
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.160
And we have the same thing in the painting
of the period, the paintings,

15
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.550
for example, by Edouard Manet.

16
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.939
Is this one romantic,
or is it impressionist,

17
00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:12.983
or is it a little bit of both?

18
00:01:15.967 --> 00:01:18.230
Well, a little bit of both.

19
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.580
But moving to the music,
let's look at a score.

20
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.350
I'll play a bit.

21
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.710
But first I want to ask you how do
you feel as you listen to this music?

22
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.096
Do you feel relaxed or energized?

23
00:01:33.096 --> 00:01:37.506
Do you want to go jogging,
go to the gym and pump some iron, or

24
00:01:37.506 --> 00:01:40.530
perhaps lie down and take a nap.

25
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.334
You decide how you feel.

26
00:01:43.334 --> 00:01:53.334
[MUSIC]

27
00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.566
Well, fooling around a bit I know,
but you get the point.

28
00:02:12.566 --> 00:02:14.410
I think we all feel very relaxed.

29
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.060
Why is it we that feel relaxed?

30
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.800
Well there are three reasons for it.

31
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.410
First of all,
the music has no beat or pulse to it.

32
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.380
It doesn't start on the downbeat.

33
00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.498
If you look at the score which we we'll
see shortly, you can see that the melody

34
00:02:31.498 --> 00:02:36.133
is being carried across over the bar,
so we don't have strong downbeats.

35
00:02:36.133 --> 00:02:37.480
And sometimes there are,

36
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.103
[MUSIC]

37
00:02:40.103 --> 00:02:41.776
twos alternating with threes, so

38
00:02:41.776 --> 00:02:45.160
it's hard to figure out exactly
where the pulse of this is.

39
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.178
And secondly,
the music is all going down, downward.

40
00:02:49.178 --> 00:02:53.550
And generally speaking in music,
when music goes down, we feel relaxed.

41
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.968
When music goes up, we get upward,
there's a sense of growing tension,

42
00:02:57.968 --> 00:02:59.121
growing anxiety.

43
00:02:59.121 --> 00:03:01.061
But here, again, it's going down.

44
00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:02.163
It's going down this way.

45
00:03:02.163 --> 00:03:10.720
[MUSIC]

46
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.052
Now, those sounds that we heard going
down are particular kind of sound,

47
00:03:16.052 --> 00:03:17.859
called seventh chords.

48
00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:22.245
And let's take a look at the next slide
and see what we, see what we see here.

49
00:03:22.245 --> 00:03:25.605
So here we have a 7th chord,
and it's part and

50
00:03:25.605 --> 00:03:29.405
partial of the beginning
of the Claire de lune here.

51
00:03:29.405 --> 00:03:33.793
So we've got this suppressed beat and
meter, and we've got the 7th chord.

52
00:03:33.793 --> 00:03:34.954
7th chord here,

53
00:03:34.954 --> 00:03:35.511
[MUSIC]

54
00:03:35.511 --> 00:03:37.554
a triad, we see that by the brace.

55
00:03:37.554 --> 00:03:39.969
And then we add one more 3rd up on top.

56
00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:40.852
[MUSIC]

57
00:03:40.852 --> 00:03:45.448
And it has the tendency of creating
a kind of jazz-type sound.

58
00:03:45.448 --> 00:03:55.448
[MUSIC]

59
00:04:00.611 --> 00:04:03.396
That sort of sound,
sounds a bit like cocktail music.

60
00:04:03.396 --> 00:04:06.149
Or if you're in a bar somewhere,
cocktail, cocktail lounge.

61
00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:08.226
Well, that wasn't Debussy's fault.

62
00:04:08.226 --> 00:04:11.170
He was the first one to
think of this idea of

63
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.730
stringing together this descending
chains of seventh chords.

64
00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.068
Well anyway, after this long
descent of the seventh chords,

65
00:04:23.068 --> 00:04:28.592
we get to this moment at the bottom where
suddenly we've come along this way.

66
00:04:28.592 --> 00:04:31.250
Well, let me back it up just a little bit,
pick it up here.

67
00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:42.024
[MUSIC]

68
00:04:42.024 --> 00:04:45.704
Bottom, and then it rises up.

69
00:04:45.704 --> 00:04:50.289
Any time our music rises up, our
spirits soar at that particular moment.

70
00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:52.821
[MUSIC]

71
00:04:52.821 --> 00:04:54.366
And then this chord.

72
00:04:54.366 --> 00:04:56.350
[MUSIC]

73
00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:57.489
Something about that chord.

74
00:04:57.489 --> 00:04:58.846
It's a subdominant chord.

75
00:04:58.846 --> 00:05:01.494
Subdominant chords,
as opposed to dominant chords,

76
00:05:01.494 --> 00:05:03.746
subdominant chords
are always very restful.

77
00:05:03.746 --> 00:05:04.826
[MUSIC]

78
00:05:04.826 --> 00:05:07.762
Rising on the time subdominantly.

79
00:05:07.762 --> 00:05:09.922
[MUSIC]

80
00:05:09.922 --> 00:05:11.768
And then the music continues.

81
00:05:11.768 --> 00:05:21.768
[MUSIC]

82
00:05:23.248 --> 00:05:28.069
Okay, now we're about down there at
the bottom system where you see the area,

83
00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:32.467
arrow, and we're going to get a good
example of parallelism in music.

84
00:05:32.467 --> 00:05:33.686
[MUSIC]

85
00:05:33.686 --> 00:05:35.161
See all of the parts.

86
00:05:35.161 --> 00:05:39.084
[MUSIC]

87
00:05:39.084 --> 00:05:40.861
I'll play that again.

88
00:05:40.861 --> 00:05:42.869
All the parts moving together.

89
00:05:42.869 --> 00:05:46.179
[MUSIC]

90
00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:47.560
One last time.

91
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.585
[MUSIC]

92
00:05:52.585 --> 00:05:54.340
And then on it goes.

93
00:05:54.340 --> 00:06:00.063
[MUSIC]

94
00:06:00.063 --> 00:06:04.330
And so on, so
a good example of parallelism there.

95
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.530
And this brings to the, us to the issue
of contrary motion, which is part and

96
00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.370
parcel of the German style,
the German tradition,

97
00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:19.290
as opposed to parallel motion, part of
the new French impressionist style.

98
00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.710
So let's go on here and take an example.

99
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.600
I've constructed a diagram for

100
00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.950
you using as an example the Star Spangled
Banner, stripping out the harmony and

101
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:36.800
just leaving the bass and the melody,
the essential framework of the piece.

102
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.560
As you can see, although the bass
doesn't move as often as the melody, but

103
00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:47.880
every time the melody goes down,
the bass goes up, and vice versa.

104
00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.830
This creates counterpoint,
voices going in opposite directions.

105
00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:57.697
Counterpoint has provided the framework
of music, especially German music,

106
00:06:57.697 --> 00:07:00.173
ever since Bach and indeed before Bach.

107
00:07:00.173 --> 00:07:04.120
Let's hear the audio
clip that goes with this.

108
00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:14.120
[MUSIC]

109
00:07:19.696 --> 00:07:25.741
Okay, now by contrast,
let's hear an example of parallel motion,

110
00:07:25.741 --> 00:07:32.530
a radically new, untraditional idea,
all of the parts moving in lock step.

111
00:07:34.088 --> 00:07:39.069
It's the opposite of contrary motion, and

112
00:07:39.069 --> 00:07:42.438
let's play this audio clip.

113
00:07:42.438 --> 00:07:48.557
[MUSIC]

114
00:07:48.557 --> 00:07:49.751
And maybe again.

115
00:07:49.751 --> 00:07:56.556
[MUSIC]

116
00:07:56.556 --> 00:08:02.310
Let's recap now what we've seen so
far about Clair de lune.

117
00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:05.110
Well, we've seen suppressed beat and
meter.

118
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:08.815
We've seen seventh chords,
particularly descending seventh chords.

119
00:08:08.815 --> 00:08:11.251
We've seen parallel motion, and

120
00:08:11.251 --> 00:08:15.670
now we're going to meet a new chord,
the augmented triad.

121
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:21.124
And to hear that, we need to dig deeper,
go further into the piece.

122
00:08:21.124 --> 00:08:28.031
[MUSIC]

123
00:08:28.031 --> 00:08:30.748
There's the red star.

124
00:08:30.748 --> 00:08:36.668
Okay, let's hear that again.

125
00:08:36.668 --> 00:08:37.510
So that bracing sound at
the end there at the red star,

126
00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:38.110
well, that's an augmented triad.

127
00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:46.890
Now as you know, we've got major triads.

128
00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:48.603
They sound, usually sound bright.

129
00:08:48.603 --> 00:08:52.190
And we've got minor triads,
more darker sounding.

130
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:55.430
And diminished triads, well,
they usually sound tense.

131
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:57.809
And what we just met there,

132
00:08:57.809 --> 00:09:02.678
that was an augmented triad
with two major thirds in it.

133
00:09:02.678 --> 00:09:04.222
We'll talk about that in just a second.

134
00:09:04.222 --> 00:09:07.612
It sounds very strange in a way,
very bracing.

135
00:09:07.612 --> 00:09:11.308
I would sub, say that it
contains a certain shock almost,

136
00:09:11.308 --> 00:09:14.034
a certain [FOREIGN] as
the French would say.

137
00:09:14.034 --> 00:09:18.624
So let me play these for you on the
keyboard, and as you can see on the screen

138
00:09:18.624 --> 00:09:22.250
up there Mm means that you get
your big major third first and

139
00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:25.828
then up above that comes the minor third,
big, little.

140
00:09:25.828 --> 00:09:28.953
And then with the minor triad you
get the little third first and

141
00:09:28.953 --> 00:09:30.042
the big one up on top.

142
00:09:30.042 --> 00:09:34.096
And in the diminished you
get two minor thirds, and

143
00:09:34.096 --> 00:09:38.320
with the augmented triad
you get two major thirds.

144
00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.654
So here's the major triad, of course.

145
00:09:40.654 --> 00:09:41.897
[MUSIC]

146
00:09:41.897 --> 00:09:42.941
Play it again.

147
00:09:42.941 --> 00:09:44.659
[MUSIC]

148
00:09:44.659 --> 00:09:46.076
Here's the minor triad.

149
00:09:46.076 --> 00:09:49.733
[MUSIC]

150
00:09:49.733 --> 00:09:50.975
Here's the diminished triad.

151
00:09:50.975 --> 00:09:52.391
[MUSIC]
A certain tension to it.

152
00:09:52.391 --> 00:09:53.877
[MUSIC]

153
00:09:53.877 --> 00:09:56.199
And the augmented triad.

154
00:09:56.199 --> 00:09:59.311
[MUSIC]

155
00:09:59.311 --> 00:10:01.238
Okay, one more time in succession.

156
00:10:01.238 --> 00:10:02.178
Major.

157
00:10:02.178 --> 00:10:05.754
[MUSIC]

158
00:10:05.754 --> 00:10:06.694
Again.

159
00:10:06.694 --> 00:10:08.691
Major, minor, diminished, augmented.

160
00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:12.917
[MUSIC]

161
00:10:12.917 --> 00:10:14.500
Well, let's have a little quiz.

162
00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:15.470
Let's have a little quiz.

163
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:21.046
I'll play four triads for you in a row,
and you identify what they are.

164
00:10:21.046 --> 00:10:25.040
Here we go.

165
00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:35.040
[MUSIC]

166
00:10:39.622 --> 00:10:41.282
Let's do that again.

167
00:10:41.282 --> 00:10:51.282
[MUSIC]

168
00:10:53.042 --> 00:10:56.641
Now I'm sure you found that so
much fun, you'd like to do it again.

169
00:10:56.641 --> 00:10:59.845
So here's another quiz to test your skill.
