00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:10.690
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.616
The composer, Claude Debussy, spent more
of his time in the company of poets and

3
00:00:15.616 --> 00:00:17.653
painters than he did musicians.

4
00:00:17.653 --> 00:00:22.477
His principal mentor was
the poet Stephane Mallarme

5
00:00:22.477 --> 00:00:27.628
who in 1876 penned a long
work in the symbolist style

6
00:00:27.628 --> 00:00:32.466
of poetry called the Afternoon of a Faun,
[FOREIGN].

7
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:37.840
Well, the faun in this case is not
a young deer, but rather a sadder,

8
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.494
a mythological beast half man,
usually the top half is man, half goat,

9
00:00:43.494 --> 00:00:50.880
who spends his days in the lustful pursuit
of the nymphs who inhabit the deep forest.

10
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.050
Here are two images that
suggest the nature of the faun.

11
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.706
Note on the left the pan pipes,
a rustic flute from Greek antiquity,

12
00:00:59.706 --> 00:01:02.400
that the faun plays.

13
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.320
On this afternoon,
we see the faun, exhausted from

14
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.067
the mornings escapades reclining in
the still air, of the midday heat.

15
00:01:11.172 --> 00:01:15.660
Now poem as we've said is
an example of symbolist poetry.

16
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.760
The emphasis is not so much on a sequence
of sounds, that makes in tactical sense.

17
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.500
But on setting a context in which
certain words stand out, pop out.

18
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.490
And these words are frated
with special resonance.

19
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.150
Just the sensuous sound of the word.

20
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.250
And all of the associations that
come with this word in our mind,

21
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.890
sounds and associations.

22
00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.550
That's what symbolist
poetry was all about and

23
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.538
oddly that's exactly
what music is all about.

24
00:01:47.538 --> 00:01:51.660
Sounds and associations.

25
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:57.311
Let me read just a short
passage of this 103 line poem.

26
00:01:57.311 --> 00:02:07.311
[FOREIGN].

27
00:02:29.693 --> 00:02:34.826
Well, let's hear what this
artificial puff of sound,

28
00:02:34.826 --> 00:02:37.564
sounds like on the keyboard.

29
00:02:37.564 --> 00:02:40.664
Let me play it for you.

30
00:02:40.664 --> 00:02:50.664
[MUSIC]

31
00:03:00.034 --> 00:03:02.332
And now, Debussy's score.

32
00:03:02.332 --> 00:03:06.745
And as we listen, I want you to tap
your foot to the music and conduct.

33
00:03:06.745 --> 00:03:09.893
Conduct in either two or three.

34
00:03:09.893 --> 00:03:10.869
Here we go.

35
00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:20.869
[MUSIC]

36
00:04:56.705 --> 00:04:58.330
Well now that's different.

37
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.140
How well did you do with your
foot tapping and conducting?

38
00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.978
Not well, neither did I.

39
00:05:04.978 --> 00:05:08.009
It's impossible to feel a beat or
to conduct.

40
00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:13.965
Again, because of the suppressed or
hidden nature of the beat and meet.

41
00:05:13.965 --> 00:05:17.007
Let's move on further into the piece.

42
00:05:17.007 --> 00:05:18.826
[MUSIC]

43
00:05:18.826 --> 00:05:24.118
Here we are now, in the middle section,
B part of the form.

44
00:05:24.118 --> 00:05:28.949
[MUSIC]

45
00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:34.527
This sounds like romantic music,
dominated not by the by the strings,

46
00:05:34.527 --> 00:05:37.366
the lush strings playing vibrato here.

47
00:05:37.366 --> 00:05:47.366
[MUSIC]

48
00:06:01.274 --> 00:06:03.884
Okay, that's the middle part and

49
00:06:03.884 --> 00:06:09.201
now the next slide will take us to
the conclusion of Debussy's piece.

50
00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:19.201
[MUSIC]

51
00:07:05.373 --> 00:07:08.937
Note that the music doesn't so
much end, climax.

52
00:07:08.937 --> 00:07:12.690
As it does sort of quietly and
very beautifully disappear.

53
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.650
It's difficult to overestimate
the originality of this work by

54
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:19.870
Claude Debussy.

55
00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:21.670
It was so different.

56
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:24.650
Anything else that any composer
was creating at that time and

57
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:28.750
certainly different from what
the Germans were creating at this time.

58
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:32.940
As they say, this piece by Debussy
is completely outside the box and

59
00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:38.060
it changed the nature of what
the western musical box sounded like.

60
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:43.300
Opening our ears to new sounds,
new chords and new scales.

61
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.860
But by way of review,
let's just reprise what we've learned so

62
00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:50.270
far about Debussy's Afternoon of a Faun.

63
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.540
Again, the beat is suppressed.

64
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.240
This is not foot stomping music here.

65
00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:59.605
To say that there's no melody,
well that's a bit of an exaggeration.

66
00:07:59.605 --> 00:08:06.392
Maybe closer to mark to say
that we hear here flourishes.

67
00:08:06.392 --> 00:08:09.380
Arabesque, Phillips of sound if you will.

68
00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:15.530
But not melody as we traditionally known,
traditionally understood it.

69
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:17.900
And of course we have this
new found importance.

70
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:24.780
This new found sense of color splotches or
dabs of color in the orchestra.

71
00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.700
The musical form however is traditional.

72
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.870
Traditional ternary ABA.

73
00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:34.190
Indeed, that's true of Debussy's Clair
de Lune that we heard earlier as well.

74
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:36.680
New sounds but traditional form.

75
00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:42.490
At the time of the first performance of
the Prelude to The Afternoon of a Faun,

76
00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:44.740
Debussy said the following
about the piece.

77
00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:49.000
Quote, my prelude is really
a sequence of mood paintings,

78
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.820
throughout which the desire and

79
00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:56.330
the dreams of the fallen move in
the heat of the midday sun, end quote.

80
00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.850
And when the poet
Mallarme heard the music,

81
00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:03.190
he in turn said the following
about Debussy's music, quote,

82
00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:08.390
I never expected anything like it, the
music prolongs the emotion of my poem and

83
00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:11.730
paints its scenery more
passionately than could colors.

84
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:18.973
So go back and listen to this piece on
your streaming music with the textbook or,

85
00:09:18.973 --> 00:09:20.862
if you wish, on YouTube.

86
00:09:20.862 --> 00:09:23.718
Is it poetry, painting, or music?
