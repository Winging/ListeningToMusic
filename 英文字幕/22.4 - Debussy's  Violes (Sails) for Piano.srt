[MUSIC]

2
00:00:11.228 --> 00:00:15.708
Nice glissando sound there,
those rushing ascents.

3
00:00:15.708 --> 00:00:19.622
The glissando of course, is one of
the fingerprints that help us identify,

4
00:00:19.622 --> 00:00:22.392
help us recognize music in
the impressionist style.

5
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.287
Having met some new chords,
augmented triads and

6
00:00:27.287 --> 00:00:32.281
sundry seventh chords,
let's go on now to meet some new scales.

7
00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:38.112
And to get into the mood, let's take
a look at a painting by Claude Monet,

8
00:00:38.112 --> 00:00:41.606
Ships at Harbor on
the Seine River at Rouen.

9
00:00:41.606 --> 00:00:45.832
And with it, shortly,
some music by Claude Debussy.

10
00:00:45.832 --> 00:00:49.813
Debussy wrote to a friend in 1916 quote,

11
00:00:49.813 --> 00:00:54.957
you do me great honor by calling
me a pupil of Claude Monet.

12
00:00:54.957 --> 00:00:59.190
Here's a musical counterpart of this
painting about ships and sails by Monet.

13
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.133
It's a piece called Sails,
Voiles, Sails by Debussy.

14
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:06.246
But for this piece, to make sense,

15
00:01:06.246 --> 00:01:09.636
we've got to meet a new scale
that Debussy employs here.

16
00:01:09.636 --> 00:01:13.177
The whole-tone scale.

17
00:01:13.177 --> 00:01:18.666
So here, the beginning of Voiles,
you see the piano score up above there.

18
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:21.609
And below it,
we have the whole-tone scale.

19
00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:26.891
Starting on the pitch c, just as Debussy
wrote it in, in the composition.

20
00:01:26.891 --> 00:01:31.291
And at the end, we'll play the usual
C major scale by way of contrast.

21
00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:33.706
So, let's play the audio clip now.

22
00:01:33.706 --> 00:01:43.706
[MUSIC]

23
00:02:11.388 --> 00:02:15.323
Okay, and now the beginning
of the piece with the score.

24
00:02:15.323 --> 00:02:22.286
[MUSIC]

25
00:02:22.286 --> 00:02:28.264
All parallel motion, but all notes of
the whole-tone scale used an ostinato.

26
00:02:28.264 --> 00:02:30.279
A bass ostinato.

27
00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:31.386
Parallel motion.

28
00:02:31.386 --> 00:02:38.741
[MUSIC]

29
00:02:38.741 --> 00:02:39.983
Whole-tone scale.

30
00:02:39.983 --> 00:02:49.983
[MUSIC]

31
00:03:06.081 --> 00:03:08.226
As we move into the next
segment of the piece,

32
00:03:08.226 --> 00:03:10.490
we'll see that things get complicated.

33
00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.064
First note the ostinato.

34
00:03:12.064 --> 00:03:15.620
And of course an ostinato is a pattern
that repeats, whether in the bass or

35
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.000
the melody, even a rhythm again and
again and again.

36
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.110
I'll start by playing the right hand of
the ostinato to call your attention to it.

37
00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.827
And then morphed into the music
the way that Debussy wrote it.

38
00:03:29.827 --> 00:03:39.827
[MUSIC]

39
00:04:22.457 --> 00:04:25.730
Well, at the end of this,
you heard a somewhat different sound.

40
00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.190
Debussy had changed there,
almost imperceptibly morphed scale.

41
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.500
From the whole tone scale,

42
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.860
as the basis of the piece to
the pentatonic scale, a five pitch scale.

43
00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.300
As you see here.

44
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.177
So here's the 5 note pentatonic
scale plus the octave.

45
00:04:43.177 --> 00:04:47.800
Compare to the seven
note western major scale.

46
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.754
And of course it goes

47
00:04:48.754 --> 00:04:54.617
[MUSIC]

48
00:04:54.617 --> 00:04:55.552
Pentatonic or.

49
00:04:55.552 --> 00:04:58.107
[MUSIC]

50
00:04:58.107 --> 00:05:02.114
On the black notes, black keys,

51
00:05:02.114 --> 00:05:05.983
as compared to the major scale.

52
00:05:05.983 --> 00:05:15.323
[MUSIC]

53
00:05:15.323 --> 00:05:20.067
Now, the pentatonic scale has
a decidedly non-western sound to it.

54
00:05:20.067 --> 00:05:24.867
When combined with parallel motion,
that sense of the non-western,

55
00:05:24.867 --> 00:05:28.711
the non-European sound,
is particularly magnified.

56
00:05:28.711 --> 00:05:35.421
[MUSIC]

57
00:05:35.421 --> 00:05:39.880
Pentatonic scale in parallel
fifths in that particular case.

58
00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.540
Alright, Let's review
what we've learned so

59
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.790
far about Debussy's piano piece, Voiles.

60
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.219
As you saw there,
we began with the whole-tone scale.

61
00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:51.275
[MUSIC]

62
00:05:51.275 --> 00:05:52.399
Six note scale.

63

[MUSIC]

64
00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:00.922
In that fashion there was an ostinato.

65
00:06:00.922 --> 00:06:02.779
[MUSIC]

66
00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:05.995
Many ostinatos in fact.

67
00:06:05.995 --> 00:06:08.953
or
[MUSIC]

68
00:06:08.953 --> 00:06:11.555
that kind of thing,
you heard the parallelism.

00:06:11.555 --> 00:06:14.956
[MUSIC]

70
00:06:14.956 --> 00:06:17.696
Frequently, the Glissando, how's that go?

71
00:06:17.696 --> 00:06:20.727
[MUSIC]

72
00:06:20.727 --> 00:06:23.982
That kind of thing, the Glissando,
and, ultimately, toward the end,

73
00:06:23.982 --> 00:06:25.043
the Pentatonic Scale.

74
00:06:25.043 --> 00:06:35.813
[MUSIC]

75
00:06:35.813 --> 00:06:39.154
Well I'm intrigued by what
we might have learned so

76
00:06:39.154 --> 00:06:43.203
far about Debussy and impressionism and
his use of new scale.

77
00:06:43.203 --> 00:06:47.480
New at least within the tradition
of Western classical music.

78
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.089
Mozart and Beethoven, well they
certainly didn't use these scales.

79
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.910
But can we recognize them?

80
00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.480
Can we recognize the difference?

81
00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.450
Is the general educated listener
able to differentiate between,

82
00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:04.080
say, the major scale
from a pentatonic scale.

83
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.530
Well, let's see.

84
00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.380
I've put together a quiz here.

85
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.810
I'll play the audio clip
that I've prepared.

86
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.630
You'll see ten blanks on the screen, and

87
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.880
then you'll hear ten
scales that go with it.

88
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:19.720
They'll be played for you.

89
00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:25.439
So we've got ten blanks, ten audio
clips exhibiting each of these scales.

90
00:07:25.439 --> 00:07:29.574
There are ten blanks and
five scales, so each type of scale,

91
00:07:29.574 --> 00:07:31.936
each type of scale is heard twice.

92
00:07:31.936 --> 00:07:33.770
Let's take a look.

93
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:34.375
Okay?

94
00:07:34.375 --> 00:07:38.287
So we've got the ten blanks,
you'll hear ten audio clips.

95
00:07:38.287 --> 00:07:41.967
You match the scale with the blank.

96
00:07:41.967 --> 00:07:42.535
