[MUSIC]

2
00:00:07.045 --> 00:00:11.850
We just had a quiz on musical scales,
some traditional Western scales and

3
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.970
some more exotic.

4
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.862
The word of the impressionist,
Debussy in particular,

5
00:00:16.862 --> 00:00:19.580
get to know these non-Western scales.

6
00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.330
Did he travel to the Orient or
further afield to the Far East?

7
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.230
No, the Far East came to him.

8
00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.550
Came to him in Paris in 1889.

9
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.210
Here we see a photograph
of the famous Eiffel Tower,

10
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.300
it was being constructed in 1888.

11
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.696
There were all sorts of
new fangled inventions,

12
00:00:39.696 --> 00:00:43.790
some of them from the United States that
were on display here at this World's Fair,

13
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.840
including the electric lightbulb and
mechanical elevator.

14
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.600
Now because it was a World's Fair, and

15
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.510
this was the era of
Western Colonial Imperialism in the East,

16
00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.770
displays including a giant reproduction
of a temple in Cambodia were created.

17
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:08.820
And Cambodian musicians imported to Paris,
as were those from Indonesia.

18
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.980
Here we see dancers from the island
of Java, Indonesia accompanied,

19
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.230
as you can see by the arrow there on
the left, accompanied by a Gamelan.

20
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.462
Debussy, i think, pretty,
pretty much everyone else in Paris, at,

21
00:01:22.462 --> 00:01:25.480
at this time, went to the exposition.

22
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.810
And it was here that he heard this
exotic music, as he recalled,

23
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.690
quote, don't you remember the Japanese
music that was capable of expressing

24
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.990
every nuance of meaning?

25
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.930
In expressible shades,
which make our tonic and

26
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.700
dominant sounds seem weak and
empty, end quote.

27
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.828
Well, here's the type of music
that Debussy would have heard.

28
00:01:48.828 --> 00:01:53.367
And as you listen, ask yourself,
what kind of scale,

29
00:01:53.367 --> 00:01:58.612
which type of scale rest behind,
or is the heart of this music?

30
00:01:58.612 --> 00:02:08.612
[MUSIC]

31
00:02:23.142 --> 00:02:24.530
What did you think?

32
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.200
Good.

33
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.320
Pentatonic scale.

34
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.000
And the musicians weren't the only ones
affected by the Far East in this period.

35
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
So were the painters.

36
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.670
Here we see the rather
spectacular portrait

37
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.230
done by Claude Monet, of his wife,
Madame Monet [FOREIGN].

38
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.350
Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.

39
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.540
But if you go to Giverny and

40
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.380
visit Monet's home there, Giverny,
France, little bit north of Paris,.

41
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.070
You'll be struck,

42
00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.980
surely, by the fact that the art that
Monet displayed there was not his own.

43
00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.410
Not his own impressionist art.

44
00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.210
But both in the kitchen and,
as we see here in the parlor,

45
00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.650
it was flat, two dimensional Chinese art.

46
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:19.200
And at the same time did Monet had this
in his home, Debussy had this sort

47
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.640
of Chinese piece overlooking his desk,
in his study.

48
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.510
His goldfish, Poisson d'or, it's called.

49
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.532
But the odd thing is,
that the impressionist and

50
00:03:31.532 --> 00:03:37.130
the pre-impressionist
saw the exotic not only

51
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.700
in distant places, but
near to home in contiguous Spain.

52
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.300
Here are the names of some of
the pieces with Spanish connections,

53
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.825
influenced by Spanish sounds that French
composers of the period composed.

54
00:03:51.825 --> 00:03:57.530
Édouard Lalo, Symphonie espanole,
Debussy, Iberia, Ravel,

55
00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.300
Rapsodie espanole and,
of course, his famous Bolero.

56
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.970
Now Ravel actually had some Spanish roots,

57
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.840
having been born in the bask
region of northern Spain.

58
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:16.490
But no one was influenced by Spanish art
more than the painter Édouard Manet,

59
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:21.443
as is seen in his spectacular
Death of the Bull Fighter in

60
00:04:21.443 --> 00:04:26.110
The Frick Gallery in New York,
one of my favorite paintings.

61
00:04:27.218 --> 00:04:34.260
the exhibits an early two dimensional
flat plain and a focus on color.

62
00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.020
And when a troupe of Spanish
dancers visited Paris in the 1860's

63
00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.720
many responded with this image of
the flamenco dancer Lola de Valence.

64
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.320
And even the American's got
into the act judging from

65
00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.580
John Singer Sargent's Spanish Dancer.

66
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.400
More Flamenco dancing here,

67
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.640
which was exhibited in Paris by
the official academy in 1882.

68
00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:02.380
Here we see, not only the dancer but
the guitars that accompanied her,

69
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:08.240
being played and hung on the wall, and
the importance of the guitar as an emblem

70
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:15.910
of Spanish exoticism wasn't lost on Manet
as we see here in his guitar player.

71
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.990
All of which brings us
to our guitar player,

72
00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.930
our guest,
classical guitarist Solomon Silber.
