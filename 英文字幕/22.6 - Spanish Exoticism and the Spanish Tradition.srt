1
00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:03.660
So, we have a guest today.

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.450
Special treat,
former Yale College student and

3
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.090
now a graduate student at the Yale School
of Music, and more importantly,

4
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:16.220
my good friend, Soloman Silber,
classical guitarist extraordinaire.

5
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.650
So please join me in
welcoming Solomon Silber.

6
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.950
Solomon, thanks for joining us.

7
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.780
I know-.
>> Wonderful to be here.

8
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.650
>> [LAUGH] I know Solomon reasonably well.

9
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.750
And, and I'd always been impressed
by the fact that he's had a rather

10
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.160
unusual career as a clacal,
classical musician.

11
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.730
He started out as a student in
classical music at Yale College, and

12
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.210
then his life took
a somewhat unexpected turn.

13
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.719
So tell-
>> It did.

14
00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:41.581
>> Us a little about that

15
00:00:41.581 --> 00:00:42.259
please.
>> Yes.

16
00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:42.869
Absolutely.

17
00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:45.060
Well, I grew up on the instrument,

18
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.710
as a young man, since I was quite young.

19
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.557
Started at, at five actually.

20
00:00:50.557 --> 00:00:51.619
>> On the classical guitar.

21
00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:53.220
>> On the classical guitar studying, yes.

22
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.800
>> Mm-hm.
>> All through my teenage years and

23
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.560
as you said, entered the college here, and

24
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.510
then decided to pursue production,
music production and Rock and Roll music,

25
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.120
and
>> So, you must have been doing Rock and

26
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.240
Roll though, when you, I mean,

27
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.800
I can't imagine being a teenager in
those years and not doing Rock and Roll.

28
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.411
>> Sure, yes.

29
00:01:10.411 --> 00:01:12.388
[CROSSTALK] The Marshall amps
had a calling you know, indeed.

30
00:01:12.388 --> 00:01:13.245
>> [LAUGH].
>> And,

31
00:01:13.245 --> 00:01:15.855
my parents' old LP's that I discovered.

32
00:01:15.855 --> 00:01:18.450
>> Uh-huh.
>> And, decided to, to kind of chase that,

33
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.155
that sound-.

34
00:01:19.155 --> 00:01:20.515
>> Uh-huh.
>> And, and that technique.

35
00:01:20.515 --> 00:01:21.810
>> Uh-huh.
>> And, the ability to write songs, and

36
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.220
then, and to sing and
to produce which, which was fantastic.

37
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.900
And and especially, on my return
to the classical instrument, I,

38
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.640
I really felt that a lot of those
production skills helped me

39
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.240
assess the music in,
in a different sense and

40
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.040
became quite comfortable with
recording technology as well.

41
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.850
Which is very important for
classical musicians.

42
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.760
>> But, you mentioned your return, so-
>> Yes.

43
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.330
>> We have, we have to set this up
because there you are, as a young man,

44
00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.290
18 years old.

45
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.030
>> Right.
>> Presumably, Yale College.

46
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.290
>> Yes.
>> You're going to pursue

47
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.080
a career in classical music and
what happened?

48
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.450
>> I actually had an injury to my hand.

49
00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.670
It was during a sculpture course and
I cut the-.

50
00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:58.730
>> A sculpture course?

51
00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:59.692
>> Yes indeed and I-.

52
00:01:59.692 --> 00:02:01.510
>> [LAUGH]
>> I cut some, tendons, but

53
00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.050
it [INAUDIBLE]
>> Wow.

54
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.260
They were mended up, yes.

55
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.650
So, so, after the during the rehab
of the process of my hand

56
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:12.050
when I wasn't able to do the complex
techniques of, of classical music.

57
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.210
I, I really sort of came again
to the calling of Rock and Roll.

58
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.520
And, I left school and,
and, went to Manhattan,

59
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.740
found a producer, this sort of
typical pursuit of, of Rock and Roll.

60
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:24.360
>> Yeah.

61
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.200
>> Greatness out there in the stars, and
it, it was a, a fantastic experience.

62
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.210
Learned a lot toured pretty
extensively and, and-.

63
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.210
>> But then, you decided to come
back to your university education-.

64
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.060
>> Yes.
>> At Yale and

65
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.420
continue with pick that up again.

66
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.130
>> Yes, indeed.

67
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.160
I, I felt, you know, for

68
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.325
some years that although the Rock and
Roll music was, you know, I was great.

69
00:02:45.325 --> 00:02:46.980
>> Uh-huh.
>> And then, close to my heart that I,

70
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.955
that I did miss the, the expression.

71
00:02:48.955 --> 00:02:50.330
>> Uh-huh.
>> And, and the sounds and, and

72
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.860
the timbres of the classical guitar.

73
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.950
>> You, you found sal,
found salvation in classical music there.

74
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:55.730
>> Indeed.

75
00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:56.302
>> There you have it.

76
00:02:56.302 --> 00:03:01.720
So, we've got a piece,

77
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.830
the Spanish exotic Spanish repertoire
that we're going to share with you today.

78
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.990
And, as we all know, Spain and

79
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.560
the guitar are intimately linked indeed,
the guitar originated in, in Spain, and

80
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.940
outgrowth of the int, all of the Islamic
interest in the lute, I'm, I'm sure.

81
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.330
And, it originated in Spain in
the 16th century, and of course,

82
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.790
we've got that long flam, flamenco
dance tradition behind this as well.

83
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.670
And, we may be hearing
a little bit of that sound

84
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.010
with Soloman's performance
a little bit later on.

85
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.420
The pair, piece we're going to listen
to is by Juan Francisco Torreya.

86
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.820
And, he is just one of,
of several Spanish composers

87
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.260
who were active during the period
of the French Impressionist.

88
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.280
We've got Enrique Granados,
Isaac Condenes,

89
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.170
Manuel DeFeya and, of course,
Francisco Tárrega.

90
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.770
So, let,
let's talk about this piece just-.

91
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.830
>> Yes.
>> For a, a moment or so.

92
00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:00.010
It's called Recuerdos de la
Alhambra Remembrances of the Alhambra.

93
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.720
I've never been to the Alhambra.

94
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.940
I never got that far [LAUGH] south,
not that far south in, in Spain.

95
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.080
But, I'm wondering if
maybe as a teaser here.

96
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.340
And, we heard a little bit of,
of this at the beginning of our segment.

97
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.900
Play just a little bit, and we're going
to begin to think about this as music and

98
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.790
as emotional experience here.

99
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.440
So, what, what do we, the listener,

100
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.825
our listening audience, our listeners,
are listening friends here.

101
00:04:25.825 --> 00:04:29.848
What do we think of this piece,
what do we feel about the music

102
00:04:29.848 --> 00:04:32.789
that Solomon is about to
begin to share with us?

103
00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:34.054
So, play a little bit if you would please.

104
00:04:34.054 --> 00:04:44.054
[MUSIC]

105
00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:55.190
So, maybe we will pause it there.

106
00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.680
We going to hear, don't, don't despair.

107
00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.500
We're going to hear entire
piece Little bit later on.

108
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.770
So, that I will be surprised
if there is anybody out there.

109
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:10.350
And recently I asked a Yale class,
many, many tens of students in it.

110
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.662
How many of you [NOISE] didn't like this
particular business, particular sound?

111
00:05:15.662 --> 00:05:20.070
And, not one person in the room
raised his or her hand.

112
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.120
And the, and I, I think we all love it.

113
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.290
Then, the question becomes, well, why?

114
00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:25.540
Why do we love it?

115
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.020
And, thinking about this just a,

116
00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.710
a little bit, a couple of things
immediately come to mind.

117
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.470
First of all, look at look,

118
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.250
it's not like we went to central
casting here to get Sullivan, right?

119
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:35.850
>> I appreciate that.

120
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.730
>> Right?
Right, rather than spanish the,

121
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.730
the dark spanish tradition of Manet.

122
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.208
So, and the instrument,
it's, it, not only.

123
00:05:45.208 --> 00:05:47.254
[CROSSTALK] Very classy guy.

124
00:05:47.254 --> 00:05:48.340
>> Jose Ramirez.

125
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.410
>> From 70, built in Madrid.

126
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:56.220
>> Yes, indeed, and I've been playing this
instrument since I was a little child.

127
00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:02.805
It's a wonderful instrument, the older,
this is sort of, of, of that time period-.

128
00:06:02.805 --> 00:06:04.830
>> Mm-hm.
>> That was really classic for the shop.

129
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.020
And and you can actually,
I wonder if they can see in there,

130
00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.320
the Jose Ramirez stamp and the 1970 date.

131
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.990
>> Wow.
>> And actually,

132
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.725
inside it was stamped by the particular
man who built this guitar-.

133
00:06:15.725 --> 00:06:17.080
>> Mm-hm.
>> From, from scratch.

134
00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.630
>> Yeah.

135
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.440
>> One luthier con,
completed this whole process.

136
00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.140
>> So, it's pa, I mean,
the instrument itself is.

137
00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.930
Is actually physically from, from Spain.

138
00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.410
And there, we, we've got some
wonderful melodic lines here.

139
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.820
I particularly love that
descending melodic sequence.

140
00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.197
We've got some harm,
strong harmonic pulls from time to time.

141
00:06:35.197 --> 00:06:39.493
[MUSIC]

142
00:06:39.493 --> 00:06:42.822
That sort of sequence in there as well.

143
00:06:42.822 --> 00:06:44.930
And then we have a few other things.

144
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:46.410
The most important, I suppose,

145
00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:50.450
the thing we're picking up that makes it
sound exotic, is that tremolo business.

146
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:53.890
Which is very specific to
the Spanish tradition, and

147
00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:57.010
comes out as I understand it,
the Flamingo tradition.

148
00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:00.430
So, how do you do that,
can you demonstrate what's going on here?

149
00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:01.350
>> Absolutely.

150
00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:05.400
So, what, what the idea, first of all,
the guitar has two hands, obviously,

151
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.110
that's playing it.

152
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:08.830
The right hand is in
control of all of these

153
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.000
all of these textural
>> Mm-hm.

154
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:12.940
>> Techniques.

155
00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.255
So, this particular one,
flamenco, involves the thumb or

156
00:07:16.255 --> 00:07:18.147
P [SOUND] hitting these bass notes.

157
00:07:18.147 --> 00:07:18.810
>> Mm-hm.

158
00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:20.899
[MUSIC]

159
00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:21.850
>> Cool.

160
00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:24.300
>> While the upper fingers ring,
middle and

161
00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:30.240
index AMI do the repeated
pattern on the higher note.

162
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.670
So, you get this alternation
of the bass plucking and

163
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:37.770
then the higher fingers doing
the A repeated so you end up.

164
00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:41.900
I'll do it slowly so that
>> But you're playing another, and

165
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.090
it's not just the A, it's the,
there's an E below it?

166
00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:49.670
>> Oh, when I said A I, excuse me,
the A is the is the name for the ring

167
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:52.320
finger in the classical repertoire, so
>> Oh, okay

168
00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.380
>> I have ring,

169
00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.795
middle index,
>> Ring middle index.

170
00:07:55.795 --> 00:07:57.968
>> Huh.
[MUSIC]

171
00:07:57.968 --> 00:08:02.798
And, that repeated pattern obviously has
something you are going to have to start

172
00:08:02.798 --> 00:08:03.640
slow clean.

173
00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.200
And then eventually, you build up the.

174
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.520
>> [LAUGH] So, you must have
to practice this very slowly.

175
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.050
>> A couple hours.

176
00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:09.970
>> Do you every get
carpal tunnel syndrome?

177
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:13.200
>> Well, you try to relax and then,
take some breaks, some stretching.

178
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:18.330
But, it's, it's very important, posture
and as you know, to, to, to maintain the.

179
00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.730
The, the tension from the back and,

180
00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:24.765
and the scapula must be sort
of pulling on the instrument.

181
00:08:24.765 --> 00:08:25.630
>> Uh-huh.
>> But also, relaxed.

182
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.800
Shoulders down, back straight.

183
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:28.420
>> Oh.

184
00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.420
And, it's always good to work out
a little bit around the edges.

185
00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.550
>> Really?
[LAUGH] Hey, that applies for

186
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:34.370
all professions.

187
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:35.160
>> Indeed it does.

188
00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.720
>> So I think what we'd like to
do now is perhaps go ahead and

189
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:39.810
hear this entire piece.

190
00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:43.460
The piece itself is rather straightforward
in terms of its structure.

191
00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:46.470
We have a lovely triple meter.

192
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:47.690
It's kind of slow grace.

193
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:51.090
So, I think it adds to,
to the relaxed quality of it-.

194
00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:52.760
>> Just rhyme.

195
00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:57.870
>> Two, three, one, two, three,
one, two, oh who doesn't like that.

196
00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:01.960
There's, triple meter is always
more relaxing than duple meter.

197
00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:06.750
So, we ha, have that and
we have a pleasing here, as well.

198
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:11.700
We've got the exotic quality of
the Flamenco tremolo sound in there,

199
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.770
but at the same time,
we have a rather regular pattern

200
00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:18.870
of a minor statement of a thematic idea,
a slightly different major statement.

201
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:22.540
And, back to the minor,
then back again to the major.

202
00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:23.980
And what else do have?

203
00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:30.230
Well, it's all organized in bars of 16,
units of 16 bar aggregates.

204
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:31.370
So, that's rather traditional.

205
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:35.620
We've been dealing with that in classical
music from the beginning of our course.

206
00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:39.250
And then finally, we should say just
a word about what's going on in the Coda,

207
00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:40.650
because that's kind of cool.

208
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:43.970
Is this piece fundamentally in major or
is it in minor?

209
00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:46.420
>> Mm.
>> And in that coda, he's tweaking that,

210
00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:48.783
that, that cool third.

211
00:09:48.783 --> 00:09:57.536
[MUSIC]

212
00:09:57.536 --> 00:10:00.799
[SOUND] So, there's the [INAUDIBLE],
the sixth to the, back down to the fifth.

213
00:10:00.799 --> 00:10:01.378
[SOUND]

214
00:10:01.378 --> 00:10:02.902
[MUSIC]

215
00:10:02.902 --> 00:10:10.207
And then, we get.

216
00:10:10.207 --> 00:10:15.770
And then, we get at one point
the minor third coming at maybe.

217
00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:17.170
Ba di di di di.

218
00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:21.609
Ba di da.

219
00:10:21.609 --> 00:10:22.967
Is it going to be major or
is going to be minor?

220
00:10:22.967 --> 00:10:25.568
[MUSIC]

221
00:10:25.568 --> 00:10:29.968
So, we'll see,
we'll see what key this ends up in.

222
00:10:29.968 --> 00:10:31.107
Is it major or minor?

223
00:10:31.107 --> 00:10:31.780
Okay?

224
00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:35.448
Solomon Silver playing
Remembrances of the Alhambra.

225
00:10:35.448 --> 00:10:45.448
[MUSIC]

226
00:14:35.318 --> 00:14:39.120
[APPLAUSE] Wonderful.

227
00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.860
And, thank you so much for
wonderful artistry.

228
00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:45.575
So, if you'd like to hear more
great music by Solomon Silber.

229
00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:47.180
Here's what you do.

230
00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:48.670
He's got a website.

231
00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:53.110
So, get out there and
support this talented young man.

232
00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:57.360
It'll be a win for Solomon and, more
importantly, it'll be a win for all of us.

233
00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.813
Solomon, again, thanks so much.

234
00:14:58.813 --> 00:14:59.960
>> Much appreciated.

235
00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:00.600
Wonderful to be here.
