2
00:00:05.675 --> 00:00:08.480
I want to start this segment with
a slide to make what I think is

3
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.470
an important point.

4
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.340
Our historians have long recognized
that with the impressionist and

5
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.950
post impressions color, as distinct and

6
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.060
different from the line in painting
became increasingly important.

7
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.500
But what we need to recognize is that
the same thing happened in music.

8
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.260
With the impressionist such as Debussy,
color became so

9
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.860
important that it was
gradually separated from line.

10
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.630
Up to this point in history of music,
color was subservient to line or

11
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.720
melody, it reinforced melody.

12
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.370
Indeed, how do we
recognize when listening.

13
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.180
What is melody?

14
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.050
Well, often we're given a clue, a hint,
because when a new distinctive collection

15
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.280
of pitches comes into play,
it is presented by,

16
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.110
it's highlighted by a new and
distinctive sound.

17
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.090
Let me give you an example
here by using 2 audio clips.

18
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.890
Examples of the traditional way,
the way of Western romantic music,

19
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.200
actually all Western music,
classical romantic.

20
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.000
The first one here is by Dvorak and
then one by Brahms.

21
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.780
Actually we've heard of
both of these before.

22
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.830
The Dvorak clip comes from
the New World Symphony.

23
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.710
You'll hear here a bit of introduction and
then a distinct aggregate,

24
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.650
distinct collection of pitches.

25
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.630
But the thing that really catches our
ear is the sound of the instrument,

26
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.450
the English Horn.

27
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.940
Melody and color work together here.

28
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.657
They are unified with the aim of making us

29
00:01:42.657 --> 00:01:46.832
hear this as a distinctive melody.

30
00:01:46.832 --> 00:01:50.450
[MUSIC]

31
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.193
Okay.

32
00:01:51.193 --> 00:02:01.193
[MUSIC]

33
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.690
All right, so melody and instrument come
in together, they reinforce one another.

34
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.810
Now, another example,
this one from Brahms.

35
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.030
We'll hear a distinctive dying out and
then some new pitches.

36
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.240
But again, auditorially,
we're paying attention

37
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.910
to this melody because it's presented,
it's tied to a French Horn.

38
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.560
When the melody comes in,
so does a new instrument.

39
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.920
It's almost as if the French Horn is
saying, hey, here comes the melody.

40
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.600
[MUSIC]

41
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.227
Vibration.

42
00:02:44.227 --> 00:02:54.227
[MUSIC]

43
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.685
Okay, but now a different approach
by Debussy, colors enter but

44
00:03:09.685 --> 00:03:14.300
they don't seem to be tied to a string or
a line of distinct pitches.

45
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.170
They seem to float.

46
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.776
Float, just as color.

47
00:03:23.454 --> 00:03:33.454
[MUSIC]

48
00:03:54.597 --> 00:04:00.260
Let's try to drive this point home
by means of a few more images.

49
00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.130
We'll go back to a clear example
of realism by Gustave Courbet.

50
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.720
The colors work with the lines.

51
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.870
But most important,
they stay within the lines.

52
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.210
With the next image,
the distinction between line and

53
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.770
color is a good deal less clear.

54
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:20.550
Line seems to be taking
a back seat to color.

55
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:25.800
Now here, with Henri Matisse's,
The Red Studio, the intensity

56
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.290
of the red begins to overrun,
go beyond the lines of the object.

57
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.330
And the same thing is true of the,
somewhat later painting by Raoul Dufy,

58
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.610
The Red Violin.

59
00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.130
Color is now seen to
have its own intensity.

60
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.310
This point can be clearly made by turning,
again, to Henri Matisse and

61
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.870
to a composition he created in 1909.

62
00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.538
La Danse, The Dance,

63
00:04:50.538 --> 00:04:55.600
we see here the flesh
tones of the dancers.

64
00:04:56.605 --> 00:05:00.790
But Matisse did this same
composition two years later.

65
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.050
And now look at the difference.

66
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:08.160
Here the angles of the limbs of
the dancers are slightly more acute,

67
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.630
but the real difference lies
in the emotional impact.

68
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.400
The intensity of the color red.

69
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.270
Pure color is carrying the day.

70
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.510
And of course with modernism and
post modernism, color alone and

71
00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:27.060
the power of pure abstract color
becomes a chief means of expression.

72
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.540
And this is true of
modernist music as well.

73
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.800
New textures and colors seize the day.

74
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.150
They override the melody as we
have traditionally understood it.

75
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:44.119
Let's end with some modernist art,
painting by ro, Mark Rothko, and

76
00:05:44.119 --> 00:05:50.695
here's some modernist music by
contemporary American composer John Adams.

77
00:05:50.695 --> 00:06:00.695
[MUSIC]

78
00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.331
On we go to the bracing
sounds of modernism.
