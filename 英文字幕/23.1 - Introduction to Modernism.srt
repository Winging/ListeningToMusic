[MUSIC]

2
00:00:18.377 --> 00:00:20.710
Boy, those were bracing sounds.

3
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.050
That'll wake you up from the warm
security blanket of romanticism.

4
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.720
So, we've come to modern music,
modernism in music.

5
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.510
Modernism, individual arts.

6
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.090
Modernism in music began
shortly after 1900, just before

7
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.640
the beginning of the first world war, and
continued until after the second word war.

8
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.730
And in some ways,
it continues even to today.

9
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.170
So there's an irony here.

10
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.230
What we call modern music or modernist
music is now more than a hundred years

11
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:57.070
old, so modernism is no longer
modern in a chronological sense.

12
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.540
But if modern means a radical
departure from traditional values

13
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.540
then this description holds true.

14
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.290
Again, it's a radical departure
from traditional values.

15
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.480
This music shocks us even more
intensely than does the recent art

16
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:19.550
of the post-modernist period,
roughly 1945 down to the present.

17
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.160
So modernist art was shocking too, but

18
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.870
not quiet to the same
degree as modernist music.

19
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.410
To make the point we're gonna do
a little test, a little quiz here.

20
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.180
We're going to place you
in a dark room for a day.

21
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.420
Well not really for a day, for a little
while, and have you engage in an activity.

22
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.760
You'll have one of two choices,

23
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.810
you can choose to sit with only this
painting by Wassily Kandinsky or

24
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.440
sit and listen to this music
by Arnold Schoenberg of 1911.

25
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.200
Which do you choose?

26
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.764
As you can see, here's the painting.

27
00:01:56.764 --> 00:02:06.764
[MUSIC].

28
00:02:27.315 --> 00:02:28.740
Well, which did you prefer.

29
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.340
Well, not long ago I gave this
same choice to exactly one hundred

30
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.130
undergraduate students.

31
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.494
And do you know how many
choose the modernist music?

32
00:02:38.494 --> 00:02:43.468
Exactly two, yes only two.

33
00:02:43.468 --> 00:02:48.010
[LAUGH]
Why didn't they choose the music?

34
00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.240
Well the first point,
it's an intriguing one.

35
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.770
Is it possible that we have
a more visceral reaction,

36
00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.000
a more intense response to sound
than we do to visual images?

37
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.780
Maybe images don't move us,

38
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.070
don't frighten us to the same degree
as do sounds, musical or otherwise.

39
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.690
As I'm fond of saying, you don't get
frightened at horror films until the music

40
00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.130
starts to get really creepy, but
let's move to the more obvious point.

41
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:24.860
Why does almost no one among this body of
general listeners choose the Shermberg?

42
00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.340
Well through our listening to music
we peoples all around the world

43
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.320
have developed various templates for
music that have things in common.

44
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:43.610
In our templates for example, is the
expectation or the desire for consonants.

45
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.090
Schoenberg was also a painter.

46
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.130
We have in this music of Arnold
Schoenberg, no scale, no melody, chords,

47
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.520
meter for example, as we think of a scale,
melody, chords, and meter.

48
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:03.820
Now this transition to Schoenberg's music,
which forces us to rethink our template,

49
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.800
wasn't as abrupt as his
music might suggest.

50
00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.280
Back in the 1850's, Wagner and

51
00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.100
Liszt began to use chromaticism,
which obscured the scale and the triad.

52
00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.170
And there was a similar gradual
evolution in the visual arts,

53
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.450
as we'll see by our next little quiz.

54
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:31.090
I'll show you five images, ranging
from roughly 1850 to 1915, 65 years,

55
00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:37.990
and you arrange them in
correct chronological order.

56
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.270
They represent in order photographic
realism, impressionism,

57
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.590
cubist's style, expressionist style,
and purely abstract art.

58
00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.130
There is one image of each style,
again, realism, impressionism, cubism,

59
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.910
expressionism, and abstract art.

60
00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.170
The images will be numbered for
you, one, two, three, four, five,

61
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:03.830
and you put them in correct
order chronologically.

62
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:04.460
Okay.

63
00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.120
Here we go.

64
00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.735
Slide number one.

65
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.600
Slide number two.

66
00:05:14.581 --> 00:05:16.520
Slide number three.

67
00:05:19.596 --> 00:05:21.390
Slide number four.

68
00:05:23.967 --> 00:05:26.030
Slide number five.

69
00:05:28.345 --> 00:05:34.231
Okay and
the correct order chronologically is four,

70
00:05:34.231 --> 00:05:38.040
two, one, five, three.

71
00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.370
Correct order would be Courbet,
Monet, Picasso,

72
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:46.060
Kokoschka, and Malevich in that order.

73
00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.920
So in this period of fewer than 65 years,

74
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:55.490
we went from art as we know it
to art as we don't know it.

75
00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.410
Obviously, styles change.

76
00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.540
An absence of stylistic change would
denote an absence of creativity.

77
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.630
A period of intellectual sterility and
that wouldn't happen.

78
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.510
So styles change and
they overlap as you can see.

79
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:16.480
So romanticism overlaps with impressionism
and impressionism with modernism and

80
00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:21.200
modernism with post modernism,
each in succession.

81
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:27.640
Now modernism transformed, distorted,
disrupted, whatever you wanna use

82
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:32.210
by way of a term, the tradition
of 19th century romantic music.

83
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:38.260
Modernist composers were aware of that
tradition, maybe even fearful of it.

84
00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.550
The so called anxiety of influence.

85
00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:48.810
So modernism rebels against romanticism,
but in so doing, it has to engage it.

86
00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:53.280
It has to establish a counterpoint,
a dialogue with tradition.

87
00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:59.190
Post modernism seems consciously,
consciously unaware of tradition.

88
00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:03.020
It takes art on its own terms,
on everyone's terms.

89
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.090
We'll get to post-modernism next time.

90
00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:09.680
Here we want to dive deep into modernism.

91
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.660
And don't worry,
don't be afraid, you'll be fine.

92
00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:17.720
We'll start with Igor Stravinsky.
