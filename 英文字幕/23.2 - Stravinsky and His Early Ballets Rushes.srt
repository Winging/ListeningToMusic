[MUSIC]

2
00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:12.935
Here's a collage or
dip dish that I've put together and

3
00:00:12.935 --> 00:00:18.009
a question, in the photo on the right,
is Igor Stravinsky and

4
00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:23.490
to his left, is a drawing of
Stravinsky w ho created this drawing.

5
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.860
Well, the person standing
next to Stravinsky

6
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.770
is his good buddy Pablo Picasso.

7
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.240
Wait a minute, you'll say.

8
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.890
I thought Stravinsky was Russian.

9
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.140
How did he get here with Spaniard Picasso?

10
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.800
Well the common point of union was Paris.

11
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.790
Both Picasso and Stravinsky were drawn
to Paris in the early 20th century.

12
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.580
Paris before New York,
was the artist capital of the world.

13
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.720
Stravinsky came to Paris
because of this person,

14
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:03.950
the person that we see in the center of
the next photos here, of this triptych.

15
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.303
In the center, we see the arts
impresario Serge Diaghilev.

16
00:01:08.303 --> 00:01:13.500
And on the right you see the famous
choreographer, modernism Vaslav Nijinsky.

17
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.030
Back in Russia, Diaghilev had formed
a dance company that he called

18
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.510
the ballet russes or Russian Ballet.

19
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.610
But the point of it was
to export Russian art and

20
00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.230
especially ballet to the West,
to artistic Paris.

21
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.760
He, Diaghilev,
formed an idea for a ballet and

22
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.470
then he pulled together scenic designers,
choreographers such as Nijinsky,

23
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.660
composers such as Stravinsky
all to create the show.

24
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.260
What Diaghilev wanted to sell
the Parisians in effect was imported

25
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.870
Russian exoticism.

26
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.260
Let's look at these two posters for
productions by Diaghilev

27
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.240
involving his ballets russes,
one of 1914 and one of 1910.

28
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.870
You can see the stereotypical
image of what

29
00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.250
dancers from the steppes of Russia
were supposed to look like.

30
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.530
In quick succession,
Stravinsky was commissioned to create and

31
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.330
the he executed three ballet scores for
Diaghilev's dance troupe,

32
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.660
the Firebird, Petrushka and
the Rite of Spring.

33
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.436
Here's a bit of music from the first
of these, the Firebird of 1910.

34
00:02:26.436 --> 00:02:30.290
What do you think of this music,
does it sound like modernism to you?

35
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.600
Is it romantic or is it modern?

36
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:42.600
[MUSIC]

37
00:03:25.932 --> 00:03:28.440
Well, it's really romantic.

38
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.917
That's over the top romanticism
of the sort created in Russia

39
00:03:32.917 --> 00:03:37.491
by Rimsky-Korsakov as heard in
his beautiful Scheherazade.

40
00:03:37.491 --> 00:03:41.425
It is not surprising Firebird sounds
much like Scheherazade because

41
00:03:41.425 --> 00:03:45.303
Rimsky-Korsakov was Stravinsky's
teacher in St. Petersburg.

42
00:03:45.303 --> 00:03:49.020
But with Stravinsky's next ballet russes,

43
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.450
Petrushka of 1911 we
have a different sound.

44
00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.860
A different world of sound.

45
00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.550
We're taken to a village fair and
a puppet show in rural Russia.

46
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.680
You can see on the image
here of the puppet show,

47
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.630
up above the stage the title Petrushka,
spelled out in the Cyrillic alphabet.

48
00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.700
As you listen to the music, try to
identify three things that you're hearing

49
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.160
that are not part of musical romanticism.

50
00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.490
Things that take us away
from the romantic aesthetic.

51
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.554
Try to conduct this in two or
three as we go.

52
00:04:28.554 --> 00:04:38.554
[MUSIC]

53
00:04:55.689 --> 00:05:00.297
Well, the first thing that we notice is
a different sort of orchestral texture,

54
00:05:00.297 --> 00:05:03.360
a much more brittle, more metallic sound.

55
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.262
We don't hear the warm, lush [SOUND]
bravado rich sound of the violins.

56
00:05:08.262 --> 00:05:11.900
Instead, we hear the woodwinds and
a lot of percussion.

57
00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.150
Metallic, percussive equals
a more modern sound.

58
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.220
And how did we do conducting this?

59
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.020
Well for me, it's impossible.

60
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.230
Of course, there's a lot of syncopation,
but it's impossible

61
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:30.540
because the meters are always changing,
so we have irregular meters.

62
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.417
Groups of two, and then groups of
three are continually alternating.

63
00:05:34.417 --> 00:05:39.258
And we have,
now only more than one in succession,

64
00:05:39.258 --> 00:05:43.670
but more than one meter simultaneously.

65
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.000
And thus, polymeters.

66
00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:53.690
As we can see on the slide here,
we're coming along

67
00:05:53.690 --> 00:06:00.350
in a three four meter in one part but
a seven eight meter in another part.

68
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.580
So in effect we have seven eighth
notes against six eighth notes.

69
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.930
Seven against six in succession but
we also simultaneous meters here,

70
00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:15.190
polymeters, because we have five eight
time up here and then two four times.

71
00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.600
So we have really five against
four eighth notes there.

72
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.127
And then a succession,
you can see over here,

73
00:06:23.127 --> 00:06:28.372
of running five eight, seven eight,
five eight, eight eight, and

74
00:06:28.372 --> 00:06:33.457
sometimes that's going five against
four eighth notes and so on.

75
00:06:33.457 --> 00:06:36.034
So it's very complex.

76
00:06:36.034 --> 00:06:38.511
Let me try to follow along here
as we listen to the audio,

77
00:06:38.511 --> 00:06:41.320
we'll see how we'll do,
we'll have at a run at this.

78
00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.895
We'll follow along here
with the melody and

79
00:06:44.895 --> 00:06:48.479
see how complex rhythmically this sounds.

80
00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:58.479
[MUSIC]

81
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:04.883
So we'll pause it there.

82
00:07:04.883 --> 00:07:07.668
And as you see I didn't do
a great job of following there.

83
00:07:07.668 --> 00:07:08.782
It's very complex.

84
00:07:08.782 --> 00:07:10.880
It's racing along.

85
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.560
And this is a reduced piano score, so

86
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:19.160
the full score that Stravinsky
created is even more complex.

87
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.440
So it's the orchestral texture,
more metallic and

88
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.720
percussive, and it's especially
the rhythm, this complex rhythm,

89
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:32.150
that is the innovative quality
of this modernism here.

90
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:36.495
Now, with the next ballet
score that Stravinsky wrote,

91
00:07:36.495 --> 00:07:39.933
it's not the texture and
the rhythm alone but

92
00:07:39.933 --> 00:07:45.022
also the revolutionary harmonic
dissonance that we experience.
