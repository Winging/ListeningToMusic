[MUSIC]

2
00:00:14.901 --> 00:00:17.901
Let's take a trip to Paris,
and who wouldn't like that?

3
00:00:17.901 --> 00:00:21.301
Paris, New York, Vienna,
what's not to like?

4
00:00:21.301 --> 00:00:26.019
So here we are in Paris with
an overview thanks to Google Earth.

5
00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:28.672
We see the river Seine and
on the right bank,

6
00:00:28.672 --> 00:00:31.199
the area leading to the Champs-Elysee.

7
00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.279
And at A on the Avenue Montaigne,
the Theatre des Champs-Elysees.

8
00:00:37.279 --> 00:00:42.470
In Stravinsky's day and still today,
this was a very fashionable area,

9
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:48.700
tres chic, with lots of expensive shops,
Hermes and Louis Vuitton for example.

10
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.337
And on this Avenue Montaigne,
as mentioned, was and

11
00:00:53.337 --> 00:00:56.532
is the Theatre de Champs-Elysees,

12
00:00:56.532 --> 00:01:02.160
with its art deco exterior and
its art deco interior.

13
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.509
And it was here, on this stage, still one
of he major concert halls of Paris today,

14
00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:14.318
that Stravinsky's Rite of Spring
premiered on an unseasonably hot night,

15
00:01:14.318 --> 00:01:16.060
29 May, 1913.

16
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.428
Stravinsky had actually written
the score not in Russia, or in Paris,

17
00:01:21.428 --> 00:01:26.900
but in Switzerland, working away at
a small piano in a small apartment.

18
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:33.650
As he tells us in some remarkable
footage shot, I would guess, about 1955.

19
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.203
I can't trace the origins of this so

20
00:01:36.203 --> 00:01:41.150
I can't give the copyright
information here, but let's watch it.

21
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.930
>> Room where I composed
the Le Sacre du Pritemps.

22
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:51.920
>> The composition of the Le Sacre was
completed by the beginning of 1912.

23
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.782
>> When I composed the first
part of the Le Sacre,

24
00:01:55.782 --> 00:02:01.540
Djagilev invited me to Venice and
I started to play him these chords.

25
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.188
59 times the same chord.

26
00:02:04.188 --> 00:02:07.986
Diagilev was a little bit surprised.

27
00:02:07.986 --> 00:02:12.318
He asked me only one thing,
which was [INAUDIBLE],

28
00:02:12.318 --> 00:02:16.790
he asked me,
will it last a very long time this way?

29
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.450
And I said to the end my dear.

30
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.910
And he was silent because he
understood that the answer was serious.

31
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:36.954
[MUSIC]

32
00:02:36.954 --> 00:02:41.560
After the big,
incredible scandal of the first

33
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.100
performance of Le Sacre du Pritemps,
he was delighted.

34
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.800
>> So, there we heard Stravinsky's
reaction to Diagilev's reaction to

35
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.280
Stravinsky's score.

36
00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.450
Indeed, this was going to be a modernist
statement from beginning to end, so

37
00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.230
radical in fact that it caused a riot and
the police had to be called in.

38
00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.610
Stravinsky, as we'll see here,

39
00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.550
had to go backstage and help the
choreographer Nijinsky keep the dancers

40
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.060
going over the noise of the yelling and
screaming of the audience.

41
00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:22.850
>> Petrujka was the first thing
I wrote after the Firebird.

42
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.850
And that was written In France and
then Rome.

43
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.216
And then to Rome was a Russian ballet.

44
00:03:32.216 --> 00:03:37.192
Diagliev asked me to come and
to assist him.

45
00:03:37.192 --> 00:03:43.590
Petrusjka was a immense
advance after [INAUDIBLE].

46
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:50.590
Third advance was of course the Le Sacre
du Pritemps, that was a scandal.

47
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.750
A big scandal of [INAUDIBLE],
it was a historical scandal.

48
00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.312
The public, they shouted,
this event, and son.

49
00:04:01.312 --> 00:04:08.502
Just from the beginning and
then they sold [INAUDIBLE].

50
00:04:08.502 --> 00:04:11.160
[LAUGH] The scandal doubled.

51
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.516
Then the curtain opened on
a group of knock-kneed and

52
00:04:16.516 --> 00:04:21.284
long [INAUDIBLE] lolitas,
jumping up and down.

53
00:04:21.284 --> 00:04:25.680
[FOREIGN], the storm broke.

54
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.120
It's a spoof, a very noisy [INAUDIBLE].

55
00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.490
I went up and said, go to Hell.

56
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.182
Excuse me [INAUDIBLE].

57
00:04:38.182 --> 00:04:42.230
They came for Sheherazade or
for Cleopatra, and

58
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.980
they saw the Le Sacre du
Pritemps they were very shocked.

59
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.397
>> As Stravinsky says here in the video,
the public was expecting one kind

60
00:04:54.397 --> 00:05:00.417
of Russian ballet, Rimsky-Korsakov,
or perhaps the style of Tchaikovsky.

61
00:05:00.417 --> 00:05:10.417
[MUSIC]

62
00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:19.576
But instead, they got this.

63
00:05:19.576 --> 00:05:29.576
[MUSIC]

64
00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:36.241
Now if there's one moment that
constitutes the beginning of modernism,

65
00:05:36.241 --> 00:05:39.615
the opening salvo,
opening cannon shot of modernism,

66
00:05:39.615 --> 00:05:43.890
it's this beginning section of
Stravinsky's, the Rite of Spring.

67
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:49.980
The story isn't so radical, it's a bit
of nationalistic Russian primitivism.

68
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:55.110
Pagan tribes express traditional
rituals through dance and

69
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.730
sacrifice at the arrival of spring.

70
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:03.520
Again, the modern take
on Russian primitivism.

71
00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.500
We can see it here in
Henri Matisse's interpretation of

72
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.330
such primitive dance in
the Hermitage in St. Petersburg.

73
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.925
But Stravinsky's musical score
as you see and as you heard,

74
00:06:18.925 --> 00:06:25.000
is a massive one with lots of percussion
and brasses and divided strings.

75
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.070
Here are the divided strings
down at this part of the score.

76
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:33.720
And the percussion and
brasses in the center of the score here.

77
00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.043
And look at the size of it.

78
00:06:35.043 --> 00:06:39.220
I count vertically 28 parts in all.

79
00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:45.620
The revolutionary aspect of this,
as we first heard, is the rhythm.

80
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.590
It's complex because different parts
are playing rhythms simultaneously,

81
00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:51.680
hence the term polyrhythms.

82
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:57.210
And you can see on the screen there,
and I'll tap maybe on my trusty table.

83
00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.343
[MUSIC]

84
00:07:00.343 --> 00:07:01.460
That's one rhythm, and then.

85
00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.800
[MUSIC]

86
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.620
That's another, and.

87
00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.523
[MUSIC]

88
00:07:08.523 --> 00:07:09.340
That's the third.

89
00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:10.540
And then the trumpets are playing.

90
00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.533
[MUSIC]

91
00:07:13.533 --> 00:07:14.153
The violins.

92
00:07:14.153 --> 00:07:16.774
[MUSIC]

93
00:07:16.774 --> 00:07:19.254
And the cellos at the bottom
have the syncopation.

94
00:07:19.254 --> 00:07:26.701
[MUSIC]

95
00:07:26.701 --> 00:07:31.244
We saw this sort of thing with
Stravinsky's Petrushka, and

96
00:07:31.244 --> 00:07:35.980
in addition, here we have
different meters simultaneously.

97
00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:40.960
Different meters, and we can see on
the screen here again, 6/8 against 7/8.

98
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.894
Against, what's that down there?

99
00:07:42.894 --> 00:07:47.124
5/8 6/8 against 7/8 against 5/8.

100
00:07:47.124 --> 00:07:51.850
And again, as with Patruska,
we have irregular meters.

101
00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:58.508
Here you can see the following groups,

102
00:07:58.508 --> 00:08:02.955
let me count them for you.

103
00:08:02.955 --> 00:08:06.109
1 2 3 4, 1 2 3 4 5, 1 2, 1,
2 3 4 5 6, 1 2 3, 1 2 3 4, 1 2 3 4 5.

104
00:08:06.109 --> 00:08:10.985
But what makes this almost a brutal
brutalist passage is the fact that

105
00:08:10.985 --> 00:08:16.860
although the strings are played much
of this, they're not using bravado.

106
00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:21.510
Instead, they're striking
each pitch with a down bow,

107
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:24.430
which creates a percussive effect.

108
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:31.632
Down bow down down,
down down down down, down down.

109
00:08:31.632 --> 00:08:33.330
And so on.

110
00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:38.010
The violin is no longer a warm,
melodic instrument.

111
00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:40.970
But it's become a percussive instrument.

112
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.381
And this is also true of
the piano in this period as well.

113
00:08:45.381 --> 00:08:48.440
It's more of a percussive
instrument than a lyrical one.

114
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:55.972
Let's review how this sounds now,
with an audio clip using a real orchestra.

115
00:08:55.972 --> 00:09:05.972
[MUSIC]

116
00:09:08.347 --> 00:09:12.639
Having reviewed this iconic moment
from the point of view of rhythm,

117
00:09:12.639 --> 00:09:15.950
let's do so now with regard to pitch.

118
00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:20.610
Not only is this passage disrupted
rhythmically, the harmony,

119
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:24.300
the chords are distinctive as well.

120
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.450
And actually, there's only one chord here,
one harmony at this point.

121
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:33.720
And Stravinsky has created
it in an interesting way.

122
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:38.310
He took a major triad,
which you see on the right here.

123
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:43.260
Here's our major triad over here.

124
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:48.180
And put it with a seventh chord over here.

125
00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:53.758
And note that this major triad is actually
only a half step built on a half step,

126
00:09:53.758 --> 00:09:58.930
on a degree that is only a half step
away from the basis of this chord here.

127
00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:06.141
So it's slightly off the triad, and then
sounded together, they produce this sound.

128
00:10:06.141 --> 00:10:08.241
So here's the basic triad.

129
00:10:08.241 --> 00:10:10.920
[MUSIC]

130
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.460
Here's the triad,
here's the seventh chord.

131
00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:14.607
[MUSIC]

132
00:10:14.607 --> 00:10:19.822
Here, but once you put them together,

133
00:10:19.822 --> 00:10:23.466
you get this kind of sound.

134
00:10:23.466 --> 00:10:30.492
[MUSIC]

135
00:10:30.492 --> 00:10:36.318
A very dissonant sound
[LAUGH] to say the least.

136
00:10:36.318 --> 00:10:39.978
Oddly, this slightly disjointed sound,

137
00:10:39.978 --> 00:10:44.554
it was being created between 1910 and
1920,

138
00:10:44.554 --> 00:10:50.260
also had an exact analogue in
the visual arts at the time in cubism.

139
00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:55.703
Let me show you three paintings by three
great cubist painters of the period,

140
00:10:55.703 --> 00:10:59.650
Juan Gris, George Braque and
Pablo Picasso.

141
00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:03.620
As we look at these,
notice that all three have music and

142
00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.740
musical instruments as the subject matter.

143
00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:12.780
First, Three Musicians of Picasso
at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

144
00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:18.630
Next, Woman with Guitar in
the Pompidou Center in Paris.

145
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:26.810
And third and last, The Violin of
Juan Gris at the Kunstmuseum in Basel.

146
00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:31.883
Now, about this time
another cubist painter,

147
00:11:31.883 --> 00:11:35.371
Albert Gleizes, wrote a book, Le Cubism.

148
00:11:35.371 --> 00:11:41.540
That tells, and also graphically shows,
how the cubist artists did it.

149
00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:45.845
They would take an object, and
then repeat it slightly off center, and

150
00:11:45.845 --> 00:11:48.441
then repeat it slightly off center again.

151
00:11:48.441 --> 00:11:50.917
And then maybe take a section of it, and

152
00:11:50.917 --> 00:11:54.950
then put that section at
right angles to that section.

153
00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:57.430
And by the end, voila.

154
00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:01.220
A cubist construction with
a disjunctive effect.

155
00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:07.730
Well, as we saw, Stravinsky was creating
a similarly disruptive sound in

156
00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:13.800
music by putting triads slightly off
center, slightly against themselves.

157
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:19.500
All right, let's take a moment now
to review what we've seen thus far.

158
00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:27.050
Style elements of modern music as
exemplified in the Rite of Spring.

159
00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:31.510
Well, first of all, we've heard both in
the Rite of Spring, and in earlier in

160
00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:37.010
Petrushka, a great number of percussion
instruments and percussive sound.

161
00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:40.010
Secondly the use of strings
as percussion instruments and

162
00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:45.740
not lush sounds here but
harsh sounds, harsh playing.

163
00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:49.590
Third, more woodwinds to create
this bright brittle orchestration.

164
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:52.870
Fourth, irregular meters and polymeters.

165
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:54.650
Well, they contribute as well.

166
00:12:54.650 --> 00:13:01.900
And finally, heavy dissonances created by
polychords, chords slightly off center.

167
00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:08.130
As Stravinsky said,
this all causes a sensation.

168
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:12.009
Here's the report of one
eyewitness observer,

169
00:13:12.009 --> 00:13:17.380
a reporter who worked for
the New York paper, the New York Press.

170
00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.280
Now, defunked New York Press.

171
00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:22.630
The critic is Carl van Vechten.

172
00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:28.030
I was sitting in a box in
which I had rented one seat.

173
00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:33.050
Three ladies sat in front of me and
a young man occupied the place behind me.

174
00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:35.580
He stood up during
the course of the ballet to

175
00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.450
enable himself to see more clearly.

176
00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:41.450
The intense excitement under
which he was laboring,

177
00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:46.430
thanks to the potent force of the music,
betrayed itself presently

178
00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:52.195
when he began to beat rhythmically on
the top of my head with his fists.

179
00:13:52.195 --> 00:13:56.970
Well, a potent rhythmic force indeed.

180
00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:57.640
But in truth,

181
00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:03.270
it was the choreography, as much as
the music that provoked the outrage.

182
00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:08.434
The novelty of irregular dance
steps was equally disruptive,

183
00:14:08.434 --> 00:14:11.070
as we'll see in the next video.

184
00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:13.679
This is Millicent Hodson's and

185
00:14:13.679 --> 00:14:18.417
Robert Joffrey's recreation
of Stravinsky's ballet.

186
00:14:18.417 --> 00:14:23.999
With the costumes and choreography as
close as possible to the original.

187
00:14:23.999 --> 00:14:33.999
[MUSIC]

188
00:15:27.885 --> 00:15:31.180
Well, maybe we'll stop there.

189
00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:34.300
But of course,
you can watch the rest on YouTube.

190
00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.643
As Stravinsky said,
it was a scandal but a huge success,

191
00:15:39.643 --> 00:15:43.014
the kind of [LAUGH] scandal
we should all hope for.

192
00:15:43.014 --> 00:15:45.799
The classic [FOREIGN], the [FOREIGN].

193
00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:48.730
What happened to the Rite of Spring?

194
00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:53.380
This radical statement of modernism
that had caused such a scandal?

195
00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:58.064
Well in 1930s, the music had caught

196
00:15:58.064 --> 00:16:02.745
the ear of Walt Disney, who as you know,

197
00:16:02.745 --> 00:16:07.980
used the Rite of Spring
as the centerpiece for

198
00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:14.620
the worlds first full length
animated film, Fantasia.

199
00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:24.620
[MUSIC]

200
00:16:30.899 --> 00:16:36.560
Stravinsky's wild music had become
becalmed through this cartoon film.

201
00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:39.819
Radical modernism had become mainstream.
