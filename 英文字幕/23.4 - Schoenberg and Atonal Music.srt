2
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:14.800
Welcome back.

3
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.450
I enjoyed our last quiz in which you and
I had a chance to choose

4
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.720
a work of modern art or
one of modern music.

5
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.370
And most of you chose the art.

6
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.490
And we tried to explain why.

7
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.670
But let's have another quiz, now,
choosing just between two pieces of music.

8
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.550
Let's say, you're stranded on a beautiful
desert island but have only one piece,

9
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.450
only one piece of music to
listen to in perpetuity.

10
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.850
Time immemorial.

11
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.860
Which piece would you choose?

12
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.110
Piece one or piece two?

13
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.386
Here's piece one.

14
00:00:49.386 --> 00:00:59.386
[MUSIC]

15
00:01:11.208 --> 00:01:13.877
And now piece two.

16
00:01:13.877 --> 00:01:23.877
[MUSIC]

17
00:01:31.328 --> 00:01:35.540
Well, I would submit that most
of us would choose piece one.

18
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.510
Piece two seems a little unnatural for
reasons that we'll get into later.

19
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.080
Piece one was by Mozart.

20
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.900
Piece two by Arnold Schoenberg.

21
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.560
Who was this seminal figure to whom
I keep referencing or referring?

22
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.740
Who was Arnold Schoenberg?

23
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.288
Well, Schoenberg was born in Vienna, and
was essentially self-taught in music.

24
00:01:58.288 --> 00:02:00.870
In the 1920s, Schoenberg moved to Berlin.

25
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.860
And then in the 1930s, when the Nazis took
over Germany and Austria, he, as with so

26
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.610
many other Jews and artists and
intellectuals, fled and

27
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.610
came to the United States.

28
00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.375
Indeed, Schoenberg settled and
ultimately died in Los Angeles, in 1951.

29
00:02:18.375 --> 00:02:22.160
And the Schoenberg family is
still prominent in Los Angeles,

30
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.926
in legal circles, legal profession today,

31
00:02:24.926 --> 00:02:28.990
having played a role in
the infamous OJ Simpson trial.

32
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.600
Small world.

33
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.310
Anyway, as a young man,

34
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.350
Schoenberg wasn't sure if he was
going to be a musician or a painter.

35
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:42.150
As you can see, he was skilled in painting
in the expressionist style of art,

36
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.970
as practiced in Vienna and Munich and
Berlin, around this time, around 1910.

37
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.480
Actually, the prototype of
expressionist art might be the creation

38
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.290
of Norwegian artist Edvard Munch and
his famous, The Scream.

39
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.660
You can see the similarities
to Schoenberg's art here.

40
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.670
German or Nordic expressionism is very
different from French impressionism.

41
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.665
With impressionism, it's the receiver,
the viewer, who fashions the ultimate

42
00:03:15.665 --> 00:03:19.820
effect of the painting in his or
her own mind.

43
00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.580
With expressionism, it's the artist alone
attempting not to create a scene or

44
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.320
mood of some external subject or
object, but

45
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:34.330
rather the mood of the artist exporting
the inner feelings of the artist.

46
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.290
Expressionist art is full of anxiety,

47
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.140
fear, intensity, angst,
as the Germans would say.

48
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.880
And we've got plenty of
angst in Schoenberg's

49
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.710
iconic work of musical
expressionism Pierrot Lunaire.

50
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.110
Premiered in 1912,

51
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:59.440
Pierrot Lunaire is Schoenberg's setting
of 21 poems by poet Albert Giraud.

52
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.680
Pierrot is a clown, a clown from
traditional italian puppet and

53
00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.590
carnival shows, Commedia dell'Arte.

54
00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.060
But here, Pierrot is not just any clown,
but a sad clown.

55
00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.850
And a clown who is slightly crazy,
indeed loony.

56
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:15.650
A clown who has,

57
00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:21.150
like the werewolf, come under the spell
of the full moon, la lune, in French.

58
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.440
Loony.

59
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.100
So, this clown borders on the hysterical.

60
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.040
Schoenberg's music will
sound a bit hysterical, too.

61
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.680
This is atonal music,
music without a tonal center.

62
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.160
If we take scales away, as we know them,
and take away triads and

63
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.920
take away functional chord progressions,
we end up with music without a key.

64
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.380
Music without a tonal center.

65
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.360
Atonal music.

66
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:55.090
This feeling of disruption, disjunction
is affected by something called octave

67
00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.640
displacement, which destroys
a sense of melody as we know it.

68
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.208
Or perhaps,
challenges us to hear melody in a new way.

69
00:05:04.208 --> 00:05:05.542
Let me play a tune.

70
00:05:05.542 --> 00:05:07.611
Can you identify this tune?

71
00:05:07.611 --> 00:05:11.181
So let me play this for you.

72
00:05:11.181 --> 00:05:18.389
[MUSIC]

73
00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:19.823
Okay, let's do it again.

74
00:05:19.823 --> 00:05:26.530
[MUSIC]

75
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:27.798
Can you hear that?

76
00:05:27.798 --> 00:05:29.433
Yeah, that really was.

77
00:05:29.433 --> 00:05:32.504
[MUSIC]

78
00:05:32.504 --> 00:05:36.050
Something as simple as
Mary Had A Little Lamb.

79
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.100
But each of the pitches was taken and
removed,

80
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.920
was displaced an octave from one another.

81
00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.130
And that's what makes this music hard
to recognize, hard to understand.

82
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.030
Here, we see a passage through
Pierrot Lunaire as Schoenberg wrote it

83
00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.600
on the left, and
as he might have written it.

84
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.940
He could have written it if he wanted to,
to make it more readily understandable.

85
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.420
So let me see if I can duplicate
this on the screen here.

86
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.535
Here's what Schoenberg wrote.

87
00:06:04.535 --> 00:06:09.907
[MUSIC]

88
00:06:09.907 --> 00:06:12.676
And here's what we probably
would have preferred to hear.

89
00:06:12.676 --> 00:06:18.482
[MUSIC]

90
00:06:18.482 --> 00:06:23.600
And finally, the sense of disjunction and
hysteria is magnified here by a new

91
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:29.630
kind of vocal delivery that Schoenberg
created, called Sprechstimme, speech/song.

92
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:34.050
Something that's neither speech nor
song, but halfway between the two.

93
00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.700
The little X's that you see on the notes
here are Schoenberg's signs or

94
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.490
commands to use Sprechstimme.

95
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:46.920
Okay, let's focus now on song number
six of Pierrot Lunaire, Madonna.

96
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:47.900
Here's the full text.

97
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:53.870
Our hysterical clown has
a vision of the mother of Christ,

98
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:59.300
Madonna, at the cross,
gazing upon her crucified son.

99
00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:04.590
She is expressing her inner feelings
at this excruciating moment.

100
00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:09.820
Notice that the text here refers
to her eyes as rot und offen.

101
00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.730
Surely, the line in the text
caused Schoenberg to create

102
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:13.730
this sort of music here.

103
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:21.320
But also, to recreate it in his painting
at about the same time, Red Gaze, of 1910.

104
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.720
So we have the hallucination
of the clown gazing upon Mary

105
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:30.550
at the cross who looks down
at us with eyes red and open.

106
00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:35.500
Did we realize that the human
in the red gaze is a female?

107
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.233
Perhaps that's why Schoenberg
created this setting of songs,

108
00:07:39.233 --> 00:07:41.799
created Pierrot Lunaire for female voice.

109
00:07:41.799 --> 00:07:46.370
Let's listen to unique
approach to text and music.

110
00:07:49.907 --> 00:07:59.907
[MUSIC]

111
00:08:47.731 --> 00:08:51.268
And now, an instrumental interlude.

112
00:08:51.268 --> 00:08:55.606
[MUSIC]

113
00:08:55.606 --> 00:08:59.511
The text continues.

114
00:08:59.511 --> 00:09:09.511
[MUSIC]

115
00:09:51.929 --> 00:09:53.860
Did you like that last chord?

116
00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:59.040
When Arnold Schoenberg created
atonal music such as this,

117
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.340
he entered a brave new land.

118
00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:04.550
But it was a lawless land,
there were no rules.

119
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:09.520
In tonal music, we knew that this
set of pitches was to be followed by

120
00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:13.920
this set of pitches, and
then onto this next set of pitches.

121
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.665
There was a hierarchy.

122
00:10:15.665 --> 00:10:19.160
Sub-dominant chord would go
to the dominant chord, and

123
00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:23.360
that would then move on
to the final tonic chord.

124
00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:27.170
Now, with atonal music,
there is no hierarchy.

125
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:29.400
And all 12 pitches are equal.

126
00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:35.900
But if all 12 pitches are equal, why
choose any one pitch at any given time?

127
00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.910
The composer had absolute freedom.

128
00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:43.810
But as Igor Stravinsky observed
in his poetics of music, nothing,

129
00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:47.140
nothing is more frightening for the
creator and maybe for every individual.

130
00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:51.180
Nothing is more frightening
than absolute freedom.

131
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:55.240
At least with tonal music,
the composer had a template of tried and

132
00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:59.667
true tonal chord progressions and
tried and true musical forms.

133
00:10:59.667 --> 00:11:03.585
So Schoenberg had created
a conundrum of sorts.

134
00:11:03.585 --> 00:11:07.280
[LAUGH] He was a prisoner
of absolute freedom.

135
00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:10.150
How did he solve the problem?

136
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:15.779
He invented a new system of rules,
and thereby created 12-tone music.
