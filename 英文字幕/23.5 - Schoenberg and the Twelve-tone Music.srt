2
00:00:15.546 --> 00:00:18.957
When Arnold Schoenberg and
others created atonal music,

3
00:00:18.957 --> 00:00:22.020
he also created a problem, as we've seen.

4
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.930
With no guide or game plan for
musical structure, how to proceed?

5
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.800
Well Schoenberg came up with a system, a
set of rules that gave structure to music.

6
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.170
A kind of music called 12-tone
music because it uses,

7
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.600
in sequence,
all 12 tones of the chromatic scale.

8
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.840
It's also called serial music because
the 12 pitches come in a fixed series.

9
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.900
Here's how the game is played.

10
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.940
First, the composer can choose
any pleasing sequence of pitches,

11
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.660
but all 12 pitches, all chromatic notes
within the octave have to be used, and

12
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.970
have to come in a series,
or in a sequence of 12.

13
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.430
This is called the row.

14
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.730
The row many start on any pitch.

15
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.740
You could start on C, or E, or
F sharp, or B flat, whatever.

16
00:01:18.062 --> 00:01:21.030
The pitches in the row may
sound vertically as a chord.

17
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.140
You could have one, two,
three come in succession, or one, two,

18
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.240
three sound simultaneously.

19
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.250
The rows may overlap.

20
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.180
The row may go backward.

21
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.750
We call that retrograde motion.

22
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.500
The row may go upside down,
be inverted, or an exact mirror image.

23
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.190
That's called inversion.

24
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.300
The row may go upside down and
backward, retrograde inversion.

25
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.090
And finally, the composer can
use any meters and rhythms.

26
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.720
Rhythm is not a primary issue here.

27
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.420
Well, as they say, a picture is worth
a thousand words, and if that's true,

28
00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.250
maybe a video is worth a 100,000.

29
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.080
So that's what we're gonna do.

30
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.180
We're gonna turn to a video now, and

31
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.923
try to simplify all this by
visualizing how 12-tone music works.

32
00:02:08.923 --> 00:02:10.425
We've got a good video here.

33
00:02:10.425 --> 00:02:13.030
It's posted on YouTube by one Nava Glick.

34
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.050
I can't find out anything about our
Nava Glick, but she says that she hopes

35
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.340
someone will find this useful,
and we thank her for sharing.

36
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.560
>> This means that every single
note in an octave is played.

37
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.180
>> So you can see, she's color
coded the pitches of the scale.

38
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.260
Now just running up the chromatic scale.

39
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.767
>> These notes are then rearranged
to make a row or series,

40
00:02:39.767 --> 00:02:43.123
where each of the 12 notes is used,
and no note is played twice.

41
00:02:43.123 --> 00:02:46.012
>> The composer uses any series he or
she wishes.

42
00:02:46.012 --> 00:02:47.974
[MUSIC]

43
00:02:47.974 --> 00:02:54.254
>> The series can then be reversed
to create a different sound.

44
00:02:54.254 --> 00:02:55.764
[MUSIC]

45
00:02:55.764 --> 00:02:58.132
>> Retrograde, going backwards.

46
00:02:58.132 --> 00:03:01.046
[MUSIC]

47
00:03:01.046 --> 00:03:05.573
And the row can go backward and
forward simultaneously against itself.

48
00:03:05.573 --> 00:03:09.760
But isn't this all a little bit strange, a
little bit crazy, a little bit unmusical?

49
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.580
Just modern mathematical games?

50
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.451
Well, no.

51
00:03:12.451 --> 00:03:17.289
Actually, JS Bach did the same
thing in this piece from

52
00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:21.296
his musical offering back in the 1740s.

53
00:03:21.296 --> 00:03:24.941
[MUSIC]

54
00:03:24.941 --> 00:03:27.943
And this is called a crab canon,
as you can see here,

55
00:03:27.943 --> 00:03:31.300
because the crab looks forward
while walking backwards.

56
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.874
The back is getting
closer to the middle now,

57
00:03:37.874 --> 00:03:42.944
the beginning of the melody is now at
the midpoint and heading toward the end,

58
00:03:42.944 --> 00:03:46.775
and my end is becoming my beginning,
my beginning my end.

59
00:03:46.775 --> 00:03:56.775
[MUSIC]

60
00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.056
And musicians from the Renaissance also
used these permutations of the melody,

61
00:04:02.056 --> 00:04:05.438
forward, backwards, upside down, whatever.

62
00:04:05.438 --> 00:04:11.720
So if Josquin and Bach could do it,
so too could Arnold Schoenberg.

63
00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:18.830
So let's continue with our presentation
of the permutations of the 12-tone row.

64
00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.590
>> Inversion is like creating
a mirror image of the original row.

65
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.290
Each note of the inversion directly
matches up with the note of the series.

66
00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.553
Okay, if the row goes up,
the inversion goes down.

67
00:04:28.553 --> 00:04:30.583
If the row goes down,
the inversion goes up.

68
00:04:30.583 --> 00:04:32.476
[MUSIC]

69
00:04:32.476 --> 00:04:34.332
>> Together, they sound like this.

70
00:04:34.332 --> 00:04:40.720
>> Then, we can get a harmony of
chords by doing row, with inversion.

71
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.080
>> Retrograde inversion is literally
just the inversion backwards.

72
00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.711
[MUSIC]

73
00:04:57.345 --> 00:04:59.325
>> All right, that's the theory.

74
00:04:59.325 --> 00:05:03.320
Let's see how it plays out
in a real piece, and for

75
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.870
that we turn to a suite, a succession
of pieces that Schoenberg wrote for

76
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.544
piano in 1924 in the 12-tone idiom.

77
00:05:11.544 --> 00:05:16.780
He selected a sequence of pitches,
12 pitches, to form his row,

78
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:22.969
and then as you can see here, rearranged
them in retrograde form, in inverted form,

79
00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:27.220
and in retrograde-inversion form.

80
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.577
The row starts on E and works to B flat.

81
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.350
The retrograde, of course,

82
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.850
starts on B flat and
works its way back to the beginning E.

83
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.465
The row starts by moving up a half-step,
and then up a full step.

84
00:05:40.465 --> 00:05:46.430
The inversion starts by going down a half
step and then down a full step, and so on.

85
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:47.400
Let's look at the score now.

86
00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.740
So there is the trio section
of a minuet of the suite.

87
00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.510
I've gone through it and
numbered the pitches in the row.

88
00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.030
Obviously, that's what all the one, two,
three, fours, and so on, are about.

89
00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:06.000
In the boxes, you can see all the various
permutations that Schoenberg applies,

90
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.410
retrograde, inversion,
retrograde-inversion, and so on.

91
00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.940
And remember that the row can start
on any pitch within the octave.

92
00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:20.290
Schoenberg likes to start it here, not
only on the pitch E, but also on B flat.

93
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:25.960
Well, with all this having been said,
let's hear the music, and

94
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.490
we'll follow along.

[MUSIC]

108
00:07:21.121 --> 00:07:26.279
Well this is a short piece, but Schoenberg
wrote an opera that lasts three hours,

109
00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:29.869
Moses und Aron,
using this same 12-tone technique,

110
00:07:29.869 --> 00:07:34.610
and for a while, serial technique or
12-tone music was all the rage.

111
00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:39.360
Even composers as different as
Igor Stravinsky and Aaron Copland

112
00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:45.020
wrote in 12-tone style, but then,
in the 1970s, they all stopped.

113
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:48.965
And for the rest of us, the general
listening public, we never got going.

114
00:07:48.965 --> 00:07:54.000
12-tone music never really caught on
with the general listening public.

115
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:54.790
Why?

116
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:56.770
Well, it went against the grain.

117
00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:59.930
It went against nature,
as we'll now explain.
