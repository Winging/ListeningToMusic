[MUSIC]

2
00:00:24.555 --> 00:00:29.468
The challenge that Modernism places
before the general listener is

3
00:00:29.468 --> 00:00:34.310
to open our ears and
accept a new level of oral dissonance.

4
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:35.389
And we have.

5
00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:40.626
Much film music and much music by heavy
metal bands such as Metallica wouldn't

6
00:00:40.626 --> 00:00:45.466
have been possible before the brittle
metallic sounds of Stravinsky and

7
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:47.707
the dissonances of Schoenberg.

8
00:00:47.707 --> 00:00:53.670
But still, Schoenberg's version of
modernism goes against the grain.

9
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.410
It's unnatural in one important way.

10
00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.840
It runs contrary to our notion
of consonants and harmony.

11
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.620
And not just in the western world,

12
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.110
not just in western music, but
in music all around the world.

13
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.520
Remember that the fundamental principle

14
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.710
of acoustics of nature
was the Overtone Series.

15
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.477
And that the earliest and

16
00:01:14.477 --> 00:01:19.115
most primary notes of the Overtone Series
were consonant notes.

17
00:01:19.115 --> 00:01:22.360
Here on the left,
we see the fundamental pitch.

18
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.480
And then, the first seven overtones.

19
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.977
And these overtones, along with
the fundamental, create a beautiful chord,

20
00:01:30.977 --> 00:01:34.596
no matter on which pitch
you place the fundamental.

21
00:01:34.596 --> 00:01:39.287
Notes higher in a series are dissonance,
but their volume is very little,

22
00:01:39.287 --> 00:01:40.630
very slight.

23
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.370
So here, let me play these chords for you.

24
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.691
We can start here, fundamental.

25
00:01:45.691 --> 00:01:52.866
[MUSIC]

26
00:01:52.866 --> 00:01:54.143
Again.

27
00:01:54.143 --> 00:01:59.657
[MUSIC]

28
00:01:59.657 --> 00:02:02.989
Let me take it down an octave.

29
00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:08.933
[MUSIC]

30
00:02:08.933 --> 00:02:11.069
Or we can start the fundamental here.

31
00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.133
[MUSIC]

32
00:02:15.133 --> 00:02:16.304
Or we could start it here.

33
00:02:16.304 --> 00:02:21.807
[MUSIC]

34
00:02:21.807 --> 00:02:23.430
And so on.

35
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.190
And no matter what fundamental we
start on, we get this beautiful chord.

36
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.220
It's baked into the universe.

37
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.700
Composers for centuries in the west wrote
music based on consonant overtones.

38
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.660
Yes, dissonance was used, but it got
quickly pulled back into consonance.

39
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.939
Here's a Mozart dissonance
resolving to a consonance.

40
00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:58.297
[MUSIC]

41
00:02:58.297 --> 00:02:59.898
Here's one by Chopin

42
00:02:59.898 --> 00:03:06.411
[MUSIC]

43
00:03:06.411 --> 00:03:07.154
Again.

44
00:03:07.154 --> 00:03:17.858
[MUSIC]

45
00:03:17.858 --> 00:03:24.336
And actually, two, now by Gustav Mahler
where he has this configuration.

46
00:03:24.336 --> 00:03:34.336
[MUSIC]

47
00:03:36.015 --> 00:03:40.554
Pulling that dissonance back in.

48
00:03:40.554 --> 00:03:43.005
No matter how long these dissonances hold,

49
00:03:43.005 --> 00:03:46.060
eventually they get reeled
back into the consonants.

50
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.180
Consonance is like a load star,
it pulls the smaller moons back into it.

51
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.850
Schoenberg of course, didn't resolve
the dissonance to consonance.

52
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.370
He loaded up entirely on dissonance.

53
00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.720
The emancipation of
dissonance as he called it.

54
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.340
But again, emancipation or
absolute freedom can be a problem.

55
00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.640
Turns out, we like our world of
sound to be ruled by consonants.

56
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.573
Remember the very first piece we explored
in our course, Also Sprach Zarathrustra

57
00:04:15.573 --> 00:04:19.595
of Richard Strauss and how it runs up and
along the overtone series?

58
00:04:22.821 --> 00:04:27.036
[MUSIC]

59
00:04:27.036 --> 00:04:28.359
Here we go.

60
00:04:28.359 --> 00:04:32.783
[MUSIC]

61
00:04:32.783 --> 00:04:34.861
And then momentarily falls back.

62
00:04:34.861 --> 00:04:37.322
[MUSIC]

63
00:04:37.322 --> 00:04:39.747
And focuses on two of the overtones.

64
00:04:39.747 --> 00:04:44.310
[MUSIC]

65
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.807
Starting again.

66
00:04:45.807 --> 00:04:53.981
[MUSIC]

67
00:04:53.981 --> 00:04:57.510
We've only gone that far
along the overtone series.

68
00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:03.050
And the point is that Strauss built
the beginning of this piece, Zarathustra,

69
00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.840
on the harmonic series, and he did the
same thing in another piece, another tone

70
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.740
poem, of about the same period that
he wrote Death and Transfiguration.

71
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:14.430
Now, Death and

72
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.870
Transfiguration concludes in the same
key as Zarathustra begins in C major.

73
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.000
So in some ways, the two are a twin.

74
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.700
Here we see the overtone
series built on C.

75
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.410
All the blue pitches are consonants and

76
00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.650
the red ones higher up in
the spectrum are dissonances.

77
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.940
And these, the red outliers,

78
00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.760
are going get pulled in,
owing to the force of musical nature.

79
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.230
As we follow the graphics
here that I've constructed,

80
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.010
you'll see the blue consonants.

81
00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:53.850
You'll see yellow pitches
that are mostly constant

82
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.390
because the composer walks his
theme along the harmonic series.

83
00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:01.610
And from time to time we'll
see red dissonance pitches,

84
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.805
red dissonance of sound.

85
00:06:03.805 --> 00:06:07.330
Schoenberg emancipates
the red dissonances,

86
00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.370
allowing them to multiply and
take over the entire tonal universe.

87
00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.350
Strauss never did that.

88
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:14.520
He never allowed that.

89
00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.840
He stuck with the old, natural order
of things, the old natural universe.

90
00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.507
As we'll now hear, by just watching and

91
00:06:25.507 --> 00:06:31.154
listening as the red is
absorbed by the bigger blue.

92
