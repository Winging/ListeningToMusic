2
00:00:15.046 --> 00:00:19.600
Today we move from Modernism
to Postmodernism and beyond.

3
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.190
What's Postmodernism?

4
00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.840
Well, obviously an artistic
movement that came after Modernism.

5
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:26.900
Now in our last session,

6
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.040
we saw how 20th century Modernism
was a reaction against tradition,

7
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.430
especially against traditional Romantic
music, the style that preceded Modernism.

8
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.738
Let's review these styles by period.

9
00:00:41.738 --> 00:00:46.885
Romanticism, late romantic music,
the large, lush,

10
00:00:46.885 --> 00:00:53.552
rich harmonic sounds of Liszt,
Brahms, Mahler, and Richard Strauss.

11
00:00:53.552 --> 00:00:57.765
Impressionism, a precursor of
both Modernism and Postmodernism,

12
00:00:57.765 --> 00:01:02.680
centered in the music of Impressionist
composer Claude Debussy.

13
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.275
Modernism, well we focused mainly on
the bracing music of Stravinsky and

14
00:01:08.275 --> 00:01:10.010
Schoenberg.

15
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.530
And finally, Postmodernism.

16
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:13.420
We'll get to that later.

17
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.400
Let's revisit the sound of these
first three style periods by means of

18
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.300
an audio quiz.

19
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.950
I've got three piano clips teed up here.

20
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.900
As you listen, identify the period from
which each of these excerpts is drawn.

21
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.940
Is the music Romantic,
Impressionist or Modernist?

22
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.724
Let's play clip A.

23
00:01:36.724 --> 00:01:46.724
[MUSIC]

24
00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:06.026
Okay, now clip B.

25
00:02:06.026 --> 00:02:15.171
[MUSIC]

26
00:02:15.171 --> 00:02:18.572
And, finally clip C.

27
00:02:18.572 --> 00:02:28.572
[MUSIC]

28
00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.239
Did you identify these style periods?

29
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.030
Good.

30
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.190
The excerpts were, in order,
first, the Impressionist style,

31
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.120
you heard the glissandos in parallel
motion in a pentatonic scale.

32
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.780
Second, well that was music of Stravinsky
from the Rite of String, Spring,

33
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.480
with it's pounding dissonance.

34
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.170
And finally, the music of
the Romantic period represented

35
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.655
by Liszt with those lush chords.

36
00:03:06.655 --> 00:03:08.490
They, they, they were all consonant.

37
00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.890
And there's a deep bass sound
as you heard at the end,

38
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.060
demonstrating the expansion of the piano.

39
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.150
And again,
we'll get to Postmodernism shortly.

40
00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.868
In our previous session on Modernism we
dealt mainly with the music of Stravinsky

41
00:03:23.868 --> 00:03:25.750
and Schoenberg, as said.

42
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.940
It was invigorating, bracing,
brash, dissonant, difficult, and

43
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.290
sometimes disorienting.

44
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.050
It was also highly complex.

45
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.905
And this learned, difficult Modernism
continued after Stravinsky and

46
00:03:38.905 --> 00:03:42.930
Schoenberg with the music of
Stockhausen and Berio and Boulez.

47
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.640
And this Modernism was based
in European musical centers,

48
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.540
in Vienna, Berlin, and Paris among them.

49
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.200
After World War II however, in the 1950s,

50
00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.110
the center of the arts in the West
shifted, shifted to New York City.

51
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.380
When abstract painters such as
Jackson Pollock, and Robert Motherwell,

52
00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.250
and Willem de Kooning, and
Mark Rothko gained prominence.

53
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.400
To suggest a sense of this, here
are paintings by Pollock, de Kooning, and

54
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.450
Rothko from
the Yale University Art Gallery.

55
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.050
Each painting is highly esteemed and
highly valued today.

56
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.260
At the same time these American artists
came to the fore, these American painters,

57
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.730
so too did American composers,
in New York City.

58
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.340
Of these, the composer of
perhaps most lasting importance,

59
00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.530
judging from his continuing
popularity today, is Aaron Copland.

60
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:49.840
Now, as you see here,
Copland composing at a piano in 1962.

61
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.200
Copland was born in Brooklyn in 1900, but
he was trained in the European tradition

62
00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:01.410
and studied under and
with the famous Nadia Boulanger in Paris.

63
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.120
Copland, almost like anyone who's
traveled extensively abroad,

64
00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.430
came to see his own country
more clearly from a distance.

65
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:15.240
As Copland said in 1939,
in Paris we all discovered America.

66
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.790
What Copland discovered about European
Modernism was that it was too complex,

67
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.910
too difficult for most European and
American audiences.

68
00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:30.190
It had no relevance to the average
American listener, especially during

69
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.910
the 1930s and 1940s, during the Great
Depression and the Second World War.

70
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:41.560
So Copland turned away to
a simpler kind of Modernism.

71
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.380
As Copland said at the time, and
here's the direct quote on this screen,

72
00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:52.080
it made no sense to ignore them,
meaning the general listening public, and

73
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.030
to continue writing as
if they did not exist.

74
00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.290
I felt that it was worth the effort
to see if I couldn't say

75
00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.410
what I had to say in
the simplest possible terms.

76
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.091
So instead of complex European Modernism,

77
00:06:07.091 --> 00:06:11.640
Copland turned to a more
listener-friendly American Modernism.

78
00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:16.630
You might call it Modernism Lite, or
Modernism made simple and practical.

79
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.460
By way of example,
Copland created Fanfare For

80
00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.770
The Common Man and Appalachian Spring
with its signature tune,

81
00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.850
A Gift To Be Simple, that you hear
now playing in the background.

82
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:40.082
So, before moving on to Postmodernism,
let's explore Copland's Gift To Be Simple.

83
00:06:40.082 --> 00:06:46.189
