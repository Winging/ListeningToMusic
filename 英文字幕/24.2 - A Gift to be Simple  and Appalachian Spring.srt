[MUSIC]

2
00:00:14.271 --> 00:00:18.695
Let's get right into
Aaron Copland's Appalachian Spring.

3
00:00:18.695 --> 00:00:24.935
It's a ballet score that he wrote for
the choreographer, Martha Graham, in 1944.

4
00:00:24.935 --> 00:00:30.064
As we listen to the opening sounds
of scene one or tableau one,

5
00:00:30.064 --> 00:00:35.715
I'm going to ask you to engage three
questions that you see here on the screen.

6
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:37.670
Where's the dissonance?

7
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.900
Is the dissonance up above,
in the higher pitches?

8
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.640
While, the consonants,
with its fundamental and

9
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.610
long, long held,
simple overtones, are down below.

10
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.080
Is the dissonance up above and
the consonant is down below?

11
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.330
Or, is the dissonance down in the base,
in the lower pitches, while the consonance

12
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.850
and the simple fundamental overtones are
sound up above, at a higher pitch level?

13
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.080
Question two,
does the dissonance sound immediately and

14
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.270
aggressively and is therefore displeasing?

15
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.830
Or B, does the dissonance unfold gradually
and is therefore not displeasing?

16
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.460
And finally question three.

17
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.320
A seemingly odd question I suppose.

18
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.700
Which of the pieces that we've studied,
Beethoven's Symphony Number five,

19
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.700
the opening of that the famous dum,
dum, dum, dum opening or

20
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.280
Richard Strauss's perhaps equally
famous also Sprach Zarathustra.

21
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.340
Does Copland's piece share much in common?

22
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:50.030
Which of these two pieces is the Copland
closer to Strauss or to Beethoven?

23
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.020
All right, those are our questions.

24
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.240
Now let's listen to the music
following the orchestral score.

25
00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.540
Remember that in a modern
conductor's score,

26
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.690
the woodwinds are up on top, with
the flute usually in the highest part.

27
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.380
So here's our two flutes up here, and

28
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.610
then ours, we have our clarinet
there that we will hear.

29
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.570
So the high woodwinds are up here.

30
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.220
The strings are all down here
with the first violin in

31
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.570
particular playing high pitches over here.

32
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.910
So we actually have two high pitch playing
sets of instruments, first violins here

33
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.520
and the flutes and clarinets up,
up here above, so you have to watch that.

34
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.690
As for the low instruments,
well here we go all the way down here

35
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.390
with the low strings holding
low notes underneath.

36
00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.300
Okay, that's the, the general layout.

37
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.890
Here we go.

38
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:49.360
We have Dawn Rising on a Spring Morning
on a Farm in Appalachia.

39
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:57.940
[MUSIC]

40
00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:58.763

46
00:03:13.557 --> 00:03:18.817

[MUSIC]

60
00:04:42.915 --> 00:04:45.180

66
00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:27.952
And then lots of low notes.

67
00:05:27.952 --> 00:05:37.833
[MUSIC]

68
00:05:37.833 --> 00:05:38.599
Clarinet.

69
00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:46.517
[MUSIC]

70
00:05:46.517 --> 00:05:51.556
And that's where we'll stop at.

71
00:05:51.556 --> 00:05:54.950
So that's the first tableau,
or the first scene.

72
00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:00.690
And, as I hope you heard, the dissonance
is actually in the higher parts,

73
00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:05.110
the first violin and the clarinet, and
sometimes in the flute, while the low

74
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.110
strings hold the fundamental pitch and
the earliest notes of the overtone series.

75
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.010
Dissonance above, consonance below.

76
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.250
That's the way music usually works.

77
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.260
And that's why we like this approach.

78
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:25.200
And you heard from the very beginning
here, the slow, relaxed tempo.

79
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.930
And thus, the dissonance doesn't sound
threatening, because it enfolds slowly.

80
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:34.240
The answer to question three.

81
00:06:35.345 --> 00:06:39.600
Copland here is following a plan,
not like Beethoven's Fifth Symphony,

82
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.700
which represents an obvious theme or
motive.

83
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.010
You've heard Beethoven present dah,
dah, dah, dum, bah, bah, bum.

84
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.273
That's a theme in a kind of,
kind of bowls us over.

85
00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:55.745
But what we've got instead is
something much more akin to beginning

86
00:06:55.745 --> 00:07:00.827
of Straus' [FOREIGN] where
the fundamental note is way down here.

87
00:07:00.827 --> 00:07:03.151
[MUSIC]

88
00:07:03.151 --> 00:07:04.669
And starting to come up with the overtones

89
00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:09.661
[MUSIC]

90
00:07:09.661 --> 00:07:10.288
And then.

91
00:07:10.288 --> 00:07:14.619
[MUSIC]

92
00:07:14.619 --> 00:07:17.760
Then a little bit of dissonance begins to
creep in, in the upper, upper register.

93
00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:24.790
So, notice here,
as we go to our next slide.

94
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:28.790
Notice here that Copland
is using polychords.

95
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:32.450
We talked about polychords before,
with Stravinsky.

96
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:38.589
Here we have one chord down here, and
another chord all the way up here.

97
00:07:38.589 --> 00:07:45.307
[MUSIC]

98
00:07:45.307 --> 00:07:49.750
Doesn't sound that dissonant
because they're spaced out.

99
00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:53.280
And they unfold over time.

100
00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.860
We could've had Copland do this.

101
00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.937
He could've taken those two triads and
placed them right over top of each other.

102
00:07:57.937 --> 00:07:59.260
[MUSIC]

103
00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:03.695
And sound much more biting, but he spaces
them out in terms of time, slowly.

104
00:08:03.695 --> 00:08:06.163
[MUSIC]

105
00:08:06.163 --> 00:08:10.700
And in terms of registers,
spaced them out.

106
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:16.510
So for the average listener
the spacing over time and the spacing

107
00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:21.900
over the sonic spectrum both low to
high creates a much more relaxed sound.

108
00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:24.780
We won't say that it's more
pleasing than the Stravinsky,

109
00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.120
because the Stravinsky is pleasing too.

110
00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.710
Just in a different way.

111
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:31.190
So we've experienced two springs here.

112
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:35.180
Actually, we've experienced three
springs if we, if we count Vivaldi.

113
00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:39.250
We've got Vivaldi's Spring Concerto
with its consonant spritely sounds at

114
00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:40.520
the beginning of spring.

115
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:45.570
We have Stravinsky, and it sort of
bursts forth with energetic dissonance.

116
00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:49.740
And the other, the third Spring
here is Aaron Copland's Spring,

117
00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.330
which unfolds gently and gradually.

118
00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:59.040
All right, now onto the most famous
movement of Copland's Appalachian Spring,

119
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.800
using the tune A Gift To Be Simple.

120
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.290
Surprisingly, Copland's tune,

121
00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:10.880
which is now famous was not famous
before Copland got his hands on it.

122
00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:15.110
He stumbled upon it and
he plucked it from obscurity.

123
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:18.420
He found it in a book of Shaker songs.

124
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:22.040
Now the Shakers were a religious
sect that had grown up

125
00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.390
in the east coast of the United States
in the 19th century.

126
00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:31.300
So Copland discovered this tune in a book
of Shaker songs published in 1848.

127
00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:35.280
Here's how that original looks.

128
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.580
Notation's a bit different
than contemporary notation.

129
00:09:38.858 --> 00:09:42.520
But, again, Copland's ballet music made,

130
00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:46.940
this tune that you see on the screen,
a gift to be simple, made it famous.

131
00:09:47.975 --> 00:09:51.650
Copland's music was arranged by
none other than John Williams and

132
00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:55.360
it was even played at
President Obama's first inauguration.

133
00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.560
Next, we see the tune in
its original version.

134
00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:03.040
This is just a modern transcription of
what you saw in the previous slide.

135
00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:08.320
And you can see that it's in four phrases,
and each phrase is four bars long.

136
00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.665
And, if you look carefully we'll
see that it begins with a,

137
00:10:11.665 --> 00:10:15.935
a classic statement of antecedent,
consequent phrase structure,

138
00:10:15.935 --> 00:10:19.675
phrase a and phrase b,
followed by an extension.

139
00:10:19.675 --> 00:10:24.320
We'll call that x, and then a return
to the concluding consequent phrase.

140
00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.880
Phrase b in a slightly different form.

141
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.080
Okay.
So, let's see what this sounds like.

142
00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:32.070
I think I've got it here at the keyboard.

143
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:34.390
Let me play this quickly for you.

144
00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:36.810
And as we play, you'll notice that this

145
00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:41.260
actually sounds a bit different than what
you might remember from the Copland.

146
00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:42.173
So, here's the original.

147
00:10:42.173 --> 00:10:52.173
[MUSIC]

148
00:11:24.682 --> 00:11:30.377
Okay, so as we heard here we've got
this simple structure of antecedent,

149
00:11:30.377 --> 00:11:34.150
consequent, extension,
and return to consequence,

150
00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:37.710
it's a very classical,
classical structure.

151
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:42.420
It goes back actually to the Classical
period, because simple folk song structure

152
00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:46.898
came to be adopted in the Classical period
with composers such as Mozart, and Haydn,

153
00:11:46.898 --> 00:11:48.140
and Beethoven.

154
00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:49.600
Beethoven, you should have of course,

155
00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:53.320
as you know in the famous Ode to Joy,
a, b, x, b.

156
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:59.360
So Copland's music is modernist here,
not post modern.

157
00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:04.530
It plays off of,
it plays against musical tradition.

158
00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:10.630
There is indeed still a dialogue here
in Copland with musical tradition.

159
00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:15.520
So Aaron Copland, he took this tune and
altered it just slightly.

160
00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.750
Here's his version of this phrase.

161
00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:24.660
And you can see here that Copland is now
writing it two four times, not four for

162
00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:29.640
times, and he has the pitches
moving along briskly in 16th notes.

163
00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:35.851
And there's a long pick-up, and
then a solo clarinet races off.

164
00:12:39.115 --> 00:12:49.115
[MUSIC]

165
00:12:53.234 --> 00:12:57.407
So now let's hear this entire tableau,
or scene, or

166
00:12:57.407 --> 00:13:00.849
section seven, scene seven of the ballet.

167
00:13:00.849 --> 00:13:05.970
But before we do,
let's take a look at an overview.

168
00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:10.739
So here you see how we
have the Shaker tune

169
00:13:10.739 --> 00:13:14.960
set out in it's 16 bar entirety.

170
00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.390
First with the clarinet solo and
then a modulation.

171
00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:25.130
And let me switch over here to
the cursor and the image on the screen.

172
00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:29.785
So here's the tune here, and it unfolds
antecedent, consequent, extension,

173
00:13:29.785 --> 00:13:31.479
consequent, all 16 bars.

174
00:13:31.479 --> 00:13:33.139
Then we get a modulation.

175
00:13:33.139 --> 00:13:36.630
Remember, modulation is like
a change of musical scenery.

176
00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:42.050
We're going from one place, sonic place,
sonic home, sonic context to another.

177
00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:43.700
We're going to modulate.

178
00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.680
And I think we'll be able
to hear that the music

179
00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:49.660
actually runs up to
a different pitch level.

180
00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:53.660
A slightly higher pitch level then the
oboe, not the clarinet the oboe will start

181
00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:56.935
all over again with the antecedent
phrase it will go for

182
00:13:56.935 --> 00:13:58.510
four bars then the consequent phrase and

183
00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:02.220
then all the woodwinds will come in and
finish that, this off.

184
00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:05.476
So let's start out now,
let's start out now.

185
00:14:05.476 --> 00:14:10.492
And I'm going to follow with my cue,
cursor here and

186
00:14:10.492 --> 00:14:14.380
let's que the music and here we will go.

187
00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:20.627
[MUSIC]

188
00:14:20.627 --> 00:14:25.349
Four, two, consequent, two, two,

189
00:14:25.349 --> 00:14:28.650
three, two, four, two.

190
00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:30.669
Extension.

191
00:14:30.669 --> 00:14:35.511
Two, two, three, two, four, two.

192
00:14:35.511 --> 00:14:36.253
Consequent.

193
00:14:36.253 --> 00:14:42.233
Two, three, two, three, two, four, two.

194
00:14:42.233 --> 00:14:43.173
Modulation.

195
00:14:43.173 --> 00:14:48.607
[MUSIC]

196
00:14:48.607 --> 00:14:55.305
Oboe, two, two, three, two,
four, two, three, two.

197
00:14:55.305 --> 00:14:59.261
[MUSIC]

198
00:14:59.261 --> 00:15:00.155
Full woodwinds.

199
00:15:00.155 --> 00:15:07.389
[MUSIC]

200
00:15:07.389 --> 00:15:08.109
Consequent.

201
00:15:08.109 --> 00:15:12.833
[MUSIC]

202
00:15:12.833 --> 00:15:17.320
Okay now we're going to break
into a variation of this theme.

203
00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.120
We've got theme variation form.

204
00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:25.370
Notice as we've seen before
with barely for example.

205
00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:31.610
The durations are double so
we have rhythmic augmentation.

206
00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:37.240
What is now the theme is being brought
in an imitation against itself.

207
00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:41.370
A little fugato,
a few light moments of imitation.

208
00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:45.990
Starts out low.

209
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:47.350
Imitated a little bit higher up.

210
00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:51.785
[MUSIC]

211
00:15:51.785 --> 00:15:56.312
Okay, get ready for
another change of musical scenery here.

212
00:15:56.312 --> 00:15:59.442
going to race up, new key.

213
00:15:59.442 --> 00:16:04.290
Trumpet will lead the way.

214
00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:06.110
New key,
now we're going the other direction.

215
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:07.680
The duration's are half.

216
00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.864
The tempo is slightly faster so,

217
00:16:09.864 --> 00:16:13.693
we've got rhythmic diminution
here with a trumpet solo.

218
00:16:13.693 --> 00:16:17.188
[MUSIC]

219
00:16:17.188 --> 00:16:20.284
Extension, with this part
of the melody up here,

220
00:16:20.284 --> 00:16:22.939
now we're back to the consequent phrase,

221
00:16:22.939 --> 00:16:28.320
now we're going to ratchet rhythmically
in the other direction, once again.

222
00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.115
Rhythmic augmentation.

223
00:16:30.115 --> 00:16:32.380
And the tempo is really slowed down.

224
00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:36.611
And in just a moment we'll
hear the full orchestra

225
00:16:36.611 --> 00:16:41.459
come in with a very augmented
presentation of the theme.

226
00:16:41.459 --> 00:16:42.283
Here we go.

227
00:16:42.283 --> 00:16:49.764
[MUSIC]

228
00:16:49.764 --> 00:16:52.202
Notice the very strong bass.

229
00:16:52.202 --> 00:16:55.105
Love this bass.

230
00:16:55.105 --> 00:16:57.229
Mostly just walking down by step.

231
00:16:57.229 --> 00:17:07.229
[MUSIC]

232
00:17:11.985 --> 00:17:15.305
Why is it the tonic?

233
00:17:15.305 --> 00:17:17.069
All right.

234
00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:21.380
That's the end of that particular tempo.

235
00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:25.170
And one final point,
how do we end this, how do we end this?

236
00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:27.820
Well, let me, let me go over here,
and we're going to ask you a,

237
00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:30.510
a couple of questions as we
see on the next slide here.

238
00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:34.820
What kind of cadence do we
have here at the very end?

239
00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.688
He's coming down in this fashion.

240
00:17:37.688 --> 00:17:41.974
[MUSIC]

241
00:17:41.974 --> 00:17:43.470
Do we get this kind of ending?

242
00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:47.094
[MUSIC]

243
00:17:47.094 --> 00:17:50.030
Well, that would be an authentic cadence.

244
00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:50.553
Again.

245
00:17:50.553 --> 00:17:52.644
[MUSIC]

246
00:17:52.644 --> 00:17:56.150
Would be ended that way
supposing you did this.

247
00:17:56.150 --> 00:18:01.107
[MUSIC]

248
00:18:01.107 --> 00:18:03.104
Well that would be a surprise right?

249
00:18:03.104 --> 00:18:05.412
So we, that would be a deceptive cadence.

250
00:18:05.412 --> 00:18:06.388
Or he might have done this.

251
00:18:06.388 --> 00:18:11.613
[MUSIC]

252
00:18:11.613 --> 00:18:16.556
Which is actually what he called an amen
cadence because ever since the 16th

253
00:18:16.556 --> 00:18:21.956
century all back, way back in the time of
Shakespeare composers would end religious

254
00:18:21.956 --> 00:18:26.693
pieces in this fashion with one chord
[SOUND] a top soprano line being held.

255
00:18:26.693 --> 00:18:29.908
[MUSIC]

256
00:18:29.908 --> 00:18:33.193
In that fashion, so
it's called an amen cadence.

257
00:18:33.193 --> 00:18:38.115
And then finally of course because it
is religious, he didn't get this out

258
00:18:38.115 --> 00:18:42.740
of a playbook, or an ebook, or
an ordinal, he took it out of a hymnal.

259
00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:49.930
So that's the signature movement
of Copland's Appalachian Spring

260
00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:52.270
using the tune A Gift to be Simple.

261
00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:54.720
Simple music for all.

262
00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.979
Now things really get simple and

263
00:18:56.979 --> 00:19:01.504
user friendly as we progress to
post modernism and minimalism.

264
00:19:08.713 --> 00:19:13.539
