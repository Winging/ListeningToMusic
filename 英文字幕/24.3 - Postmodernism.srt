2
00:00:16.398 --> 00:00:17.838
What is style?

3
00:00:17.838 --> 00:00:20.652
Well, likely the distinctive attributes,

4
00:00:20.652 --> 00:00:24.970
the noteworthy characteristics
of any object or entity.

5
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.710
What two styles are represented here?

6
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.470
Well before us,
obviously we have architecture.

7
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.362
Architecture in the classical style,
classical antiquity.

8
00:00:34.362 --> 00:00:38.765
The antiquity of ancient Greece and
Rome with its columns,

9
00:00:38.765 --> 00:00:41.944
ionic capitals and triangular pediment.

10
00:00:41.944 --> 00:00:47.314
And behind it is a representation
of a much more contemporary image,

11
00:00:47.314 --> 00:00:54.180
the exaggerated face of film star, Marilyn
Monroe, created by artist, Andy Warhol.

12
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.640
Now, a movie star,
in this case Marilyn Monroe,

13
00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.030
is something from everyday culture,
and so, too, is a tennis shoe.

14
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:08.090
Here we see an approximately 8 by
12 foot version of a tennis shoe

15
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.830
by this same pop artist, Andy Warhol.

16
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.080
What could be more commonplace
than a tennis shoe?

17
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.240
I used to wear Converse All Star
tennis shoes when I played basketball.

18
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.490
Everyone did.

19
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.300
So this is pop art, because it's popular.

20
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.607
Everyone can relate to it.

21
00:01:25.607 --> 00:01:28.626
Like it as art or not.

22
00:01:28.626 --> 00:01:33.010
It is also what we would
call postmodernist art.

23
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.598
Why postmodernism?

24
00:01:35.598 --> 00:01:40.620
Well, postmodernist art is art
that has gone beyond, that has

25
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.930
gotten beyond the anxiety of influence of
modernism, and indeed of all tradition.

26
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.410
To understand modernists like Copeland we,
that we just heard a moment or so

27
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.470
ago, it's useful to know something
about traditional musical form.

28
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.530
It makes more sense to us if we understand
antecedent consequent phrase structure,

29
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.770
idea of the fugue theme and variations,
rhythmic diminution, that sort of thing.

30
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.880
With traditional painting, similarly,
it's helpful to know something about

31
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.910
perspective, and brush technique,
and visual symbolism.

32
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.580
But with postmodernism,
you don't have to know anything.

33
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.992
And everyone is equal.

34
00:02:20.992 --> 00:02:24.274
In this case,
everyone is literally on an equal footing.

35
00:02:24.274 --> 00:02:27.227
Everyone can be an art lover.

36
00:02:27.227 --> 00:02:30.233
Everyone can be an art critic.

37
00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:34.583
So, postmodernism embraces the everyday,
the mundane,

38
00:02:34.583 --> 00:02:38.260
even the kitsch, and it glorifies it.

39
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.590
Now, here's a collage that,
that I've put together, a Warhol,

40
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.725
a Roy Lichtenstein, and
a Warhol composite.

41
00:02:46.725 --> 00:02:51.850
Cows, cartoon figures, Campbell soup cans.

42
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.910
But, some of this down-to-earth art,
postmodernist art, can sell for

43
00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.330
prices that are absolutely stratospheric,
as you can see by this next collage.

44
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.030
Why is this art worth so much?

45
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.310
Why is it art?

46
00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.700
What is art?

47
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.803
Well, these are some of the questions
that postmodernist art and

48
00:03:15.803 --> 00:03:17.750
music require that we engage.

49
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.039
At the very least,
postmodernist art asks us to stop and

50
00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:27.711
pay more attention to the little,
minimal, everyday things around us.

51
00:03:34.504 --> 00:03:44.504
