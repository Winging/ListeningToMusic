2
00:00:17.235 --> 00:00:20.475
Who's honored in the Lincoln Memorial?

3
00:00:20.475 --> 00:00:23.050
Well, Abraham Lincoln, of course.

4
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.490
What is minimalism?

5
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.310
Well, equally obvious,

6
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.100
minimalist art is art constructed out of
only the most minimal about the material,

7
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.040
which, in order to generate length,
has to be repeated again and again.

8
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.630
So, minimalist art takes a line, a
gesture, a phrase and repeats it over and

9
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.820
over, either in the same position or
in a slightly different position.

10
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.830
Minimalism started in New York City
in the 1960s and 1970s with

11
00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.550
such visual artists as Donald Judd and
Sol LeWitt.

12
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.580
Minimalism is a distinctive kind of
postmodernism, a subset of postmodernism.

13
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.090
Here's a minimalist construction by
Sol LeWitt, where simple lines and

14
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.119
primary colors are set out and
then go at right angles to one another.

15
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.307
In another LeWitt construction,
a drawing for

16
00:01:25.307 --> 00:01:30.491
a wall in the Yale Art Gallery,
a very few, simple modules,

17
00:01:30.491 --> 00:01:34.671
here rectangles,
grow to cover a larger space.

18
00:01:34.671 --> 00:01:39.279
Minimalism in music began at
the same time, in the 1960s.

19
00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:43.819
And although there was a percolation of
it in California, it was mostly again,

20
00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:46.220
a New York City experience.

21
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.038
Two composers stand out in particular,
Steve Reich and Philip Glass.

22
00:01:51.038 --> 00:01:54.890
As both Reich and
Glass have said at different times,

23
00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.260
American composers in the 1960s and
70s didn't see the need to engage,

24
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.920
didn't see the need to do battle
with the European tradition.

25
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.510
There was enough energy in America itself.

26
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.220
So, the minimalist turned away from what

27
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.000
Glass called the creepy-crawly
music of Schoenberg.

28
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.170
And composed using
the simplest of materials.

29
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.840
And here's an example.

30
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.250
It's a piano reduction of the opening
piece of a suite of pieces for

31
00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.030
chamber ensemble called
Glassworks by Philip Glass.

32
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.910
It's built on only triads and
basic seventh chords.

33
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.732
The arrows here indicate where repeated

34
00:02:38.732 --> 00:02:43.275
music occurs, let me play just a bit.

35
00:02:43.275 --> 00:02:53.275
[MUSIC]

36
00:03:26.538 --> 00:03:30.496
Sounds pretty radical because
of the constant repetition.

37
00:03:30.496 --> 00:03:32.748
But in the history of classical music,

38
00:03:32.748 --> 00:03:36.100
there have been similar
examples of musical minimalism.

39
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.341
Remember this of course.

40
00:03:37.341 --> 00:03:47.341
[MUSIC]

41
00:03:52.022 --> 00:03:56.806
The difference here is that in the Bach,
we have more direction harmonically

42
00:03:56.806 --> 00:04:01.590
in the functional chord progressions
that seem to be going somewhere.

43
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.800
The Bach is goal-oriented, teleological,
to use that fancy word again.

44
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.510
The Glass piece goes nowhere.

45
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.020
It sits in the moment.

46
00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.750
It relishes the moment forever and
then abruptly stops.

47
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.480
It is not teleological but
more trance-inducing.

48
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.700
It's sort of hypnotic.

49
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.720
It creates a different kind
of listening pleasure.

50
00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.440
Now here's another piece by Glass,
again from Glassworks, called Flow.

51
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.140
It has an additive quality to it,
as more and

52
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.840
more layers of sound,
are added to the texture.

53
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.930
Before we hear it,
let's analyze what makes it work.

54
00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.760
Let me play again,
a bit here at the piano.

55
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.068
We start out with this sound.

56
00:04:47.068 --> 00:04:49.765
There's a, [SOUND] a french horn,
I think, is up here playing this.

57
00:04:49.765 --> 00:05:00.585
[MUSIC]

58
00:05:00.585 --> 00:05:03.660
So we have just this repeated
note [SOUND] and then this.

59
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:09.744
[MUSIC]

60
00:05:09.744 --> 00:05:11.463
And then, slowly.

61
00:05:11.463 --> 00:05:12.960
[MUSIC]

62
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.510
Seventh chord will be introduced.

63
00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.800
And then another one, but
another one going against it.

64
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.230
Opposite direction.

65
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.173
One coming down as one goes up.

66
00:05:23.173 --> 00:05:26.250
[MUSIC]

67
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.393
And then he will double the tempo, and
run them both up and down simultaneously.

68
00:05:30.393 --> 00:05:34.005
[MUSIC]

69
00:05:34.005 --> 00:05:37.034
In that fashion.

70
00:05:37.034 --> 00:05:41.720
So, let's hear a bit of the original
composition Flow, by Phillip Glass.

71
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.150
And as we do so,
as these arpeggios are going up and

72
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.410
down against themselves,
we'll look at this visual image.

73
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.430
Each of these squares is
a rectangle against itself.

74
00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:02.007
You can study these rectangles or
these near images as the music plays.

75
00:06:02.007 --> 00:06:12.007
[MUSIC]

76
00:06:44.212 --> 00:06:47.745
Okay, now maybe we'll pause it or
fade it out here.

77
00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:54.650
And this same kind of repetitive
pattern process is also paramount

78
00:06:54.650 --> 00:07:00.410
in the art of British artist,
Bridget Riley.

79
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.620
Again, the emotional effect
is not teleological.

80
00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.860
Tha art doesn't work to one, grand climax,

81
00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:12.980
doesn't progress to a great
apotheosis climax at the end,

82
00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:17.200
but rather, it's repetitive, it's
reiterative, it's trance-like in a way.

83
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.280
You can get lost in this art.

84
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.200
You can get lost in this music.

85
00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.610
And here's another example
of minimalist visual art.

86
00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.820
But actually, it's a musical score,
the score John Adams,

87
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:35.580
Short Ride in a Fast Machine,
but seen up close.

88
00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:42.460
Is it minimalist art, or
a prescriptive musical score?

89
00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:43.300
Well, it could be both.

90
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.940
Let's back out here just a bit.

91
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:48.670
Take a look at this score.

92
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:49.350
There we go.

93
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:53.223
And we see it as we hear the music here,
playing in the background.

94
00:07:53.223 --> 00:07:57.412
It's going back, both forwards and
backwards, simultaneously, right side up,

95
00:07:57.412 --> 00:07:58.829
and right side down, down.

96
00:07:58.829 --> 00:08:08.442
[MUSIC]

97
00:08:08.442 --> 00:08:12.099
Okay, and with that little bit,
that little teaser.

98
00:08:12.099 --> 00:08:18.601
We'll move on to engage the music of
postmodernist composer, John Adams.

99
00:08:24.463 --> 00:08:34.463
