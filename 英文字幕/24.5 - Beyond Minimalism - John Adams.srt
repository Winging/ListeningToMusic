[MUSIC]

2
00:00:14.003 --> 00:00:17.840
I like talking about the music of
John Adams because he's a friend of mine.

3
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.700
I had lunch with him about a year or
so ago.

4
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.370
In fact we go way back.

5
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.210
Nearly fifty years ago we were
in a class together at Harvard.

6
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.400
I was a fledgling graduate assistant and
he was a gifted undergraduate.

7
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.470
We even played on the same
softball team together.

8
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.490
Adams was very talented so I watched him.

9
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.040
I paid attention.

10
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.990
His composition teacher,
normally, was Leon Kirschner,

11
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:48.470
who had been a student of Schoenberg, the
famous Arnold Schoenberg in Los Angeles,

12
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:54.235
but in Harvard, John Adams seemed more
captivated by The Beatles than Schoenberg.

13
00:00:54.235 --> 00:00:57.555
And he sensed that there were
fresh new sounds to be written.

14
00:00:57.555 --> 00:01:02.015
Now, we just heard a bit of
John Adams lively instrumental piece,

15
00:01:02.015 --> 00:01:04.730
Short Ride and a Fast Machine.

16
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.670
It's an early piece by Adam now.

17
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.740
It's almost 30,
maybe even more, 30 years old.

18
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.750
It's in a minimalist style, but in a style
more complex than most minimalist music.

19
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.050
Indeed, ironically,

20
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.790
Adam's minimalist music can be anything
other than minimalist in length.

21
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.020
He has written several full length operas,
Nixon In China, The Death of Klinghoffer

22
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.580
and most recently, Doctor Atomic,
to name just three.

23
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.650
Let's see how minimalist music or

24
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.250
expanded minimalist music might
inform an entire three-hour opera.

25
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.170
And we'll do so with a quick
look at Adams' Nixon In China.

26
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.620
Richard Nixon, 37th President
of the United States in China?

27
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.390
How could you possibly
make an opera out of that?

28
00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.570
Richard Nixon was anything but
charismatic and

29
00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:04.470
the focal point of this opera was to
be a diplomatic mission to China.

30
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.440
The beginning of the taunt between
the US and China, the thawing of

31
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.210
the Cold War in 1972,
how could Richard Nixon be exciting?

32
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.190
How could diplomacy be dramatic?

33
00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.410
We need drama in opera.

34
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.890
How could minimalist musical style,
which is built on static reiteration and

35
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.530
repetition, move forward in a compelling

36
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.580
way to a compelling end
as every good opera must?

37
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.910
I'm not kidding when I heard the title of
this, Nixon in China I said this is nuts.

38
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.260
This will not work, but it does and
let me show you how it works

39
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.942
in just one scene in this opera,
in one recitative and aria.

40
00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.700
The President's plane,
Richard Nixon's plane,

41
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.800
lands in Peking, now called Beijing.

42
00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.910
Who knew?

43
00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.990
Nixon walks out stiffly to be greeted
by the waiting Chinese dignitaries,

44
00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.650
led by Chou En-lai.

45
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.530
On the left you see an historical photo
taken by the Presidential Press Corps

46
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.220
showing the actual arrival
of Nixon's plane in Beijing.

47
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.766
And here on the bottom right
is how this same scene

48
00:03:18.766 --> 00:03:23.366
was recreated recently at
the Metropolitan Opera in New York.

49
00:03:23.366 --> 00:03:28.124
As the plane lands, and
Nixon and his wife, Pat,

50
00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:31.306
descend, a recitative begins.

51
00:03:31.306 --> 00:03:40.443
[MUSIC]

52
00:03:40.443 --> 00:03:42.485
You hear the repeated patterns.

53
00:03:42.485 --> 00:03:45.679
Typical, minimalist music,
but there's more here.

54
00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:48.384
[MUSIC]

55
00:03:48.384 --> 00:03:53.413
There are other repeated
patterns going against repeated,

56
00:03:53.413 --> 00:03:59.570
and a lot of syncopation, and
it's all happening simultaneously.

57
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.950
It's actually very complex.

58
00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.707
Maximal minimalism we'll call it.

59
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:15.980
Adam's music always sounds intentionally
slightly out of phase with itself.

60
00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.771
Beginning to hear pulsating triads.

61
00:04:20.771 --> 00:04:22.930
Hear it rising in the bass there.

62
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:29.629
[SOUND] And they will come up triad
like passing to a trumpet sound.

63
00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:32.949
And here comes the royalty
of the president.

64
00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:38.393
[MUSIC]

65
00:04:38.393 --> 00:04:46.090
[APPLAUSE]

66
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.655
[MUSIC]

67
00:04:49.655 --> 00:04:50.835
Nixon descends.

68
00:04:50.835 --> 00:04:52.758
Chou En-lai greets him.

69
00:04:52.758 --> 00:05:00.280
[MUSIC].

70
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.275
And hear them pulsating
minimalism in the background.

71
00:05:04.275 --> 00:05:14.420
[MUSIC]

72
00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.476
They exchange pleasantries.

73
00:05:16.476 --> 00:05:26.476
[MUSIC]

74
00:05:30.535 --> 00:05:33.855
Kissinger slumps down the stairs.

75
00:05:33.855 --> 00:05:40.612
[MUSIC]

76
00:05:40.612 --> 00:05:42.991
Mostly just speech.

77
00:05:42.991 --> 00:05:49.354
Musically, but plain speech.

78
00:05:49.354 --> 00:05:53.033
Okay, maybe we'll pause it right there.

79
00:05:53.033 --> 00:05:58.277
That's enough to give us a sense of
the recitative that the stage for

80
00:05:58.277 --> 00:06:00.760
the aria that follows.

81
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.140
Aria is entitled News Has
a Kind of Mystery.

82
00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:08.630
The libretto for this opera was
created by poet Alice Goodman.

83
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:14.420
Remember, except for Wagner, composers
have almost always had a literary

84
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:20.320
person fashion or
generate the libretto for him or her.

85
00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.750
And here's the text that
Alice Goodman created for this aria.

86
00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.830
It's written in blank verse
with an occasional rhyme.

87
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:36.860
News, news has a kind of mystery when I
shook hands with Chou En-lai on this bare

88
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.210
field outside Peking just now.

89
00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.340
The whole world was listening and

90
00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:46.605
then periodically we'll hear lots of text
repetition for emphasis and emotion.

91
00:06:46.605 --> 00:06:51.875
That is part of, of, of an aria,
as opposed to a recitative and then again,

92
00:06:51.875 --> 00:06:57.325
for emotional impact,
long moments of melismatic singing,

93
00:06:57.325 --> 00:07:00.255
where the soloist will take branch out,

94
00:07:00.255 --> 00:07:04.035
hold forth on just one
syllable to express emotion.

95
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:09.862
Okay, with this quick
look at the text now,

96
00:07:09.862 --> 00:07:15.897
let's go on to hear this aria
News Has a Kind of Mystery.

97
00:07:15.897 --> 00:07:25.897
[MUSIC]

98
00:07:31.408 --> 00:07:32.650
Repeated text.

99
00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:37.549
[MUSIC]

100
00:07:37.549 --> 00:07:41.298
Really only two chords pulsating in there,
just rocking back and

101
00:07:41.298 --> 00:07:42.670
forth between the two.

102
00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:52.670
[MUSIC]

103
00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:15.431
We said of course.

104
00:08:15.431 --> 00:08:20.016
[MUSIC]

105
00:08:20.016 --> 00:08:27.586
Listening.

106
00:08:29.247 --> 00:08:39.247
[MUSIC]

107
00:08:43.491 --> 00:08:44.931
Is one.

108
00:08:44.931 --> 00:08:54.931
[MUSIC]

109
00:09:07.847 --> 00:09:11.806
As we, transfixed, made history.

110
00:09:11.806 --> 00:09:15.530
So that recitative and
aria together takes nearly ten minutes.

111
00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:20.000
And I think we'd all agree that
they make compelling drama.

112
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.475
And show that in a creative
mind like that of John Adams,

113
00:09:24.475 --> 00:09:29.428
it would be possible to sustain
the minimalist aesthetic over

114
00:09:29.428 --> 00:09:33.061
the course of a long and
very pleasing opera.

115
