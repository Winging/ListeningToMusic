[MUSIC].

2
00:00:10.247 --> 00:00:14.586
So here we are, at the last segment
of the last session of our course

3
00:00:14.586 --> 00:00:16.919
Introduction to Classical Music.

4
00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.270
Today we live in the second
decade of the 21st Century.

5
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.570
And from our vantage point it might seem
like classical music is on the decline,

6
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.130
playing less and
less a role in public life.

7
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.860
There's less teaching of music in the
home, less music education in the schools,

8
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.510
and less about classical music on
the front page of the newspaper.

9
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.610
But there are hopeful signs today.

10
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.650
Technology is changing things.

11
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.490
Ticket sales for high-definition HD

12
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.500
broadcasts of the Metropolitan Opera
are being sold.

13
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.780
Executed around the world.

14
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:59.100
A hundred years ago, you had to buy large,
expensive, acoustic instrument, Piano.

15
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.680
Today, most people are more
likely to have this gadget.

16
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.430
A keyboard synthesizer.

17
00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.340
The fidelity isn't as good,
but it's small, portable and

18
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.600
you can do a lot of things with it.

19
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.690
A hundred years ago to
hear a classical concert,

20
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.760
to hear classical music you
had to go to a live concert.

21
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.620
Nowadays, all you have to do
is reach in your pocket and

22
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.270
pull out one of these things.

23
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.240
The fidelity is as not as good,
but it's small and

24
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.530
portable, and
you can do a lot of things with it.

25
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.550
It used to be that to have
a university course in classical music

26
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.688
you had to go to a university,
enroll as a student.

27
00:01:41.688 --> 00:01:47.380
Now, well, nowadays as we have seen
you can do that within the comfort and

28
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.305
convenience of your own home.

29
00:01:49.305 --> 00:01:55.100
At last count nearly 50,000
people had watched all or part.

30
00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.040
Of the material here on our course,
"Introduction to Classical Music."

31
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.670
.

32
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.410
That's more people that I've taught
in my entire career here at Yale.

33
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.720
And we did that with just one course.

34
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.430
Here's another change.

35
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:15.360
Western classical music is no
longer just a Western phenomenon.

36
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.830
Today there are people from 187 countries

37
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.810
around the world watching the sessions of
this course on western classical music.

38
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.220
The largest number is
in the United States.

39
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.480
The second largest number,
by country, is in China.

40
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.100
And here's a modern concert
hall in central Beijing

41
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.230
in which western classical
music is completely at home,

42
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.920
as you can see by the large western
style organ situated over the stage.

43
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.220
But some new concert halls
are also being built

44
00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.900
in traditional western centers of culture.

45
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.750
Another hopeful sign for
the future of classical music.

46
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:55.720
Here's the newest one.

47
00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.380
It just opened in Paris, 2015.

48
00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.830
The new home of the Orchestre de Paris.

49
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.640
This new surround sound design
makes the listener feel like he or

50
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.539
she is right in the middle of things.

51
00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.610
This is like having a ringside
seat at a boxing match or

52
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.360
a basketball game, except here
everyone is quiet and listening.

53
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.550
So this is an exciting development for
classical music.

54
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.160
Here you could more easily
bond with the performers and

55
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.180
tacitly with the members of the audience,
re-affirming your cultural values.

56
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.790
But what are your cultural values?

57
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.710
Are there such things as
universal cultural values?

58
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.770
is music a universal language?

59
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.890
Should music be experienced
in a group setting

60
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.800
to re-affirm cultural values
in a concert hall, or

61
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.710
ultimately does music speak to us
most intensely when we are alone?

62
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:54.840
What do you think?

63
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.090
We've had an entire course
now on classical music.

64
00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.670
What have we learned?

65
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:05.020
A lot of facts, surely and
I hope we've gained insights as to

66
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.650
how classical music works and
how composers communicate meaning.

67
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.570
But, ultimately, when we listen to music,

68
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.430
what music means is what the listener,
you and I, wants it to mean.

69
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:24.470
And one of the beauties of art, is that
each receiver of art can derive meaning

70
00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.400
from his or her personal experience.

71
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.800
In this case, and
make sense of the mysteries.

72
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.958
Of the beautifully organized sound.

73
00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:40.950
Mysteries of sound as beautiful
as the universe itself.

74
00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.620
So let's try a final thought experiment.

75
00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.470
I want to place you alone
with a piece of music.

76
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.690
In deep musical space.

77
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.920
The composer's name and
the title will appear on the screen.

78
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.390
Where does this music come from?

79
00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:06.210
Is its frame of reference medieval music,
or modern music, or post-modernist music?

80
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.360
Does it evoke sounds of
popular music in any way?

81
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.910
Or perhaps, music from another world?

82
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.840
Finally, what does this music say to you?

83
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.870
What thoughts come into
your mind as you hear this?

84
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.320
Where do you see yourself being?

85
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.680
Where does your memory go?

86
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.900
What emotions do you
experience as you listen?

87
00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.530
Why, perhaps, do you experience?

88
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.610
Interesting questions, all.

89
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.340
Having said this, I'll say no more.

90
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.213
Let's just listen now in the dark
to just two minutes of pure music.
