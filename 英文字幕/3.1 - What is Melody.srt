2
00:00:21.831 --> 00:00:25.680
Dreaming, by Robert Schuman,
and what a lovely melody.

3
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.690
So today,
we're going to talk about melody.

4
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.760
And, how long did it take old
Schuman to think up that idea?

5
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.940
Probably not very long,
judging from his work habits.

6
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.070
That kind of creativity is another
of the mysteries of the arts and

7
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.590
music in particular.

8
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.380
How does that happen?

9
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:46.870
But, on to melody.

10
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.750
In music, melody is the star.

11
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.220
A melody, simply said, is the tune.

12
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.100
A coherent collection of
pitches animated by a rhythm.

13
00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.230
It literally gets top billing.

14
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.760
It's up there on the top
of the musical firmament,

15
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.060
and it's almost always on the top of the
musical texture, top of the musical score.

16
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.900
The harmony underneath it acts
like a supporting character,

17
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.250
the harmony plays
a supporting role to melody.

18
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:24.600
Here's the Schuman again,
now played on another kind of keyboard.

19
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:34.600
[MUSIC]

20
00:01:56.671 --> 00:01:58.390
Notice, melody on the top and
the right hand.

21
00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.860
Harmony, underneath it, in the left.

22
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.390
When we listen to music,
most of us hear music only as the melody.

23
00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.270
We don't focus on the inner parts or
the bass.

24
00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.440
There may be an acoustical reason for
this.

25
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.700
High pitches may be more easy to perceive
than lower and potentially murkier ones.

26
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.994
I can play a melody with
accompaniment here in one range, and

27
00:02:20.994 --> 00:02:22.750
you can hear it rather clearly.

28
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.870
[MUSIC]

29
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.990
But, if I take that same melody and
play it all the way down here.

30
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.381
[MUSIC]

31
00:02:34.381 --> 00:02:37.272
It gets a little bit murky.

32
00:02:37.272 --> 00:02:37.980
Higher frequencies, we shall see,
disappear more quickly.

33
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.630
But, they sound more clear.

34
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.660
So, the melody sounds clearly above and
for

35
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.510
that reason we tend to
hear it more readily.
