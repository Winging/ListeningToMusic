[MUSIC]

2
00:00:09.047 --> 00:00:13.709
A melody, as we have said, is a coherent
collection of pitches animated by

3
00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:17.410
a rhythm and
usually supported by a harmony.

4
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.000
We can simply remember a melody or,
in the western tradition,

5
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.500
we may wanna write it down, capture it,
preserve it, using musical notation.

6
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.650
Written notation of melodies in the west,
again, goes back to the ninth century.

7
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.120
We talked this a little bit last time.

8
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.730
Here are a few images showing how pitch
notation developed for western music.

9
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.890
So on the screen to the left side you see
an early manuscript with neumes up above,

10
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.910
just squiggles, and with some letters
representing both pitch indication and

11
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.670
the Latin text of this particular chant.

12
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.850
On the right we have
the text of the chant and

13
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.160
then the neumes,
the prototypes of our musical notes.

14
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.470
As you can see on the next slide,
here we begin to get

15
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.760
horizontal lines to help us with pitch
indicators, a grid of some sort,

16
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.360
that allows us to specify particular
pitches, and you can see off to the left

17
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.195
hand side there the letters C and F,
indicating where the pitch C and F appear.

18
00:01:25.195 --> 00:01:29.425
On the right side we begin to see these
neumes become increasingly separated, and

19
00:01:29.425 --> 00:01:30.855
now, as mentioned last time,

20
00:01:30.855 --> 00:01:36.490
with a different symbols to indicate
the rhythms that are involved.

21
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.600
In the next slide,
we see that system of a grid supporting

22
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.430
pitches being confirmed
in four red lines there.

23
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.640
And on the right we see it
progressing to what we have today,

24
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.670
five lines on the stand,
again with pitch indicators out there to

25
00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.470
the left to signify what those
particular pitches are supposed to be.

26
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.780
Moving on to the next slide,
here again we see more signs for

27
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.180
clefs indicating what those lines on
which the notes sit are meant to be.

28
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.469
On the left,
we have a very deluxe manuscript from

29
00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:24.680
my own Yale University rare book library.

30
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.680
And on the right a sort of,
we'll call it, a more middle level

31
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.790
volume for an average music
consumer of the 16th century.

32
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.240
But again, we have a time signature there,

33
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.070
we have pitch indicators and
the notes sitting on a grid.

34
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.320
Finally, we're going to come to
an example of some printed music.

35
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.460
A volume here,
actually by Martin Luther on the left,

36
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:57.820
with his famous hymn tune [FOREIGN]
there,

37
00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:03.060
and you can see Martin Luther's
name actually on the printed copy.

38
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.203
And this is the soprano part,
and we see that same

39
00:03:08.203 --> 00:03:15.476
music on the right now with all four
parts set one on top of the other and

40
00:03:15.476 --> 00:03:21.007
the music ending up towards
the bottom right there.

41
00:03:21.007 --> 00:03:28.101
[MUSIC]

42
00:03:28.101 --> 00:03:33.823
So that's the way our notation developed,
and at the very end as you heard again.

43
00:03:33.823 --> 00:03:40.848
[MUSIC]

44
00:03:40.848 --> 00:03:45.690
What Martin Luther is doing there
is simply coming down the scale.

45
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.900
Right down the scale.

46
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.220
So let's talk about scales for a moment.

47
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.320
Scale in music is simply a pattern
of adjacent pitches going up or

48
00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.560
down the keyboard.

49
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.520
Different cultures have different scales.

50
00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.603
Much of Chinese music is written in a five
note scale, so called pentatonic scale.

51
00:04:03.603 --> 00:04:10.986
[MUSIC]

52
00:04:10.986 --> 00:04:13.645
That sort of sound.

53
00:04:13.645 --> 00:04:17.244
Indian Ragas sometimes
use a six note scale.

54
00:04:17.244 --> 00:04:24.105
[MUSIC]

55
00:04:24.105 --> 00:04:30.220
That's a six note scale used by
Ravi Shankar in a piece called [FOREIGN].

56
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.400
Melodies in western music, however,
are written not in patterns of five or

57
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.430
six pitches, but
in scales of seven pitches.

58
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.110
Did you ever wonder why we in the west
have seven pitches in our scale?

59
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.120
And why there's an irregularity
in the western keyboard?

60
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.810
Why there is no key at two
spots on the keyboard.

61
00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.640
If you look here on the screen you can see
that we're missing an effective black key

62
00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.250
between B and C, and E and F.

63
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.250
How did this come about?

64
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.640
It has to do with the way the ancient
Greeks back in the time of Plato and

65
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.310
Aristotle set up their melodies.

66
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.460
They privileged mathematics
above all else, and

67
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:18.110
as a result,
we end up with seven pitches in our scale.

68
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.690
A class video will explain
how this happened.

69
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.318
Okay, so we have this whole
idea of octave duplication,

70
00:05:24.318 --> 00:05:26.500
sometimes six notes, sometimes five notes.

71
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.840
We in the west have settled
on a seven note scale.

72
00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:30.820
Why did that happen?

73
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.526
Well, we had this idea
of a seven note major

74
00:05:32.526 --> 00:05:33.800
[MUSIC]

75
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.718
and seven note minor.

76
00:05:34.718 --> 00:05:35.298
[MUSIC]

77
00:05:35.298 --> 00:05:36.934
Why seven notes?

78
00:05:36.934 --> 00:05:40.528
Well for the answer to that we have to go
back to ancient Greek music theory, and

79
00:05:40.528 --> 00:05:42.870
you read about this,
it's really turgid stuff.

80
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.870
But believe it or not, I teach a course
on this at the graduate level.

81
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.440
We have to read and
poor Linda has to take this kind of stuff.

82
00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.207
We're reading Aristoxenus and
things like this.

83
00:05:51.207 --> 00:05:55.559
So what we're dealing here with is
a situation where the ancient Greeks were

84
00:05:55.559 --> 00:05:59.095
very much into mathematics as
a way of explaining the world and

85
00:05:59.095 --> 00:06:01.075
explaining music in particular.

86
00:06:01.075 --> 00:06:02.916
And they thought these
ratios were primary,

87
00:06:02.916 --> 00:06:06.209
so they had the ratio of two to one, which
gave them the octave, and three to two,

88
00:06:06.209 --> 00:06:09.283
which gave them the fifth, and
four to three, which gave them the fourth.

89
00:06:09.283 --> 00:06:12.832
They also, because the system worked
out better for their purposes,

90
00:06:12.832 --> 00:06:15.972
then jumped to nine to eight,
which gave them the whole tone.

91
00:06:15.972 --> 00:06:19.673
So they started out there and
let's say they're working down here.

92
00:06:19.673 --> 00:06:22.852
They filled in the octave up above,
and then they filled in the fifth, and

93
00:06:22.852 --> 00:06:25.850
then they filled in the fourth, and
then they came down a whole step.

94
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.600
Then they went up a fourth from that whole
step and then up a fourth from that,

95
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.950
and they were filing in, in this fashion.

96
00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.440
Interestingly enough, and
you ever wonder this?

97
00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.500
Sometimes someone wandered by a keyboard,
said that's odd.

98
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.320
What's the great oddity
about the keyboard?

99
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.570
What's strange about this keyboard?

100
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.060
It's very asymmetrical, right?

101
00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:48.590
Marcus?

102
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.860
Yeah it's missing some notes in there.

103
00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.320
It's missing something in here.

104
00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.930
Well what these are were the cracks.

105
00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.600
After the Greeks laid out their fifths and

106
00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.550
fourths and whole steps they
had these little leftovers.

107
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:05.961
They called them lainmas, and they had
these little leftovers in there, and

108
00:07:05.961 --> 00:07:08.806
that's why we end up with these
small distances between B and C.

109
00:07:08.806 --> 00:07:12.427
[MUSIC]

110
00:07:12.427 --> 00:07:13.287
That's a big step.

111
00:07:13.287 --> 00:07:15.470
[MUSIC]

112
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.026
That's a small step there.

113
00:07:17.026 --> 00:07:19.325
So the scale is actually not equal.

114
00:07:19.325 --> 00:07:22.067
A to B is one distance,
which is a large one, and

115
00:07:22.067 --> 00:07:26.592
B to C is only half that distance, and
that's because of the way the Greeks laid

116
00:07:26.592 --> 00:07:30.868
this thing out with their two to one
ratios, three to one ratios and so on.

117
00:07:30.868 --> 00:07:33.670
But in any event, we end up with this.

118
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:36.780
Now, the Greeks had a whole series of
patterns, and they called them myxolydian

119
00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:41.095
and hypomyxolydian and Phrygian and
hypophrygian and stuff like this.

120
00:07:41.095 --> 00:07:44.770
A lot of different patterns, but
in the course of history, we settled,

121
00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:49.740
beginning in the 16th and
17th Century down into just two patterns.

122
00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:53.740
What we call the major pattern and
the minor pattern.

123
00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.770
So, let's talk about that just for
a moment,

124
00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:00.060
and before we do it I
should add one other thing.

125
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.620
How, then,
do we get these other notes up here?

126
00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:06.050
Well, what we know call the black notes,

127
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:09.350
although historically
keyboards could be either way.

128
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:13.990
You could have these added notes,
black or white and

129
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:15.390
then these underneath would be black.

130
00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:17.180
So we fill these out.

131
00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:20.970
Sort of in the 14th century
all of this got filled in.

132
00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:25.340
These between B and C and E and F didn't
get filled in because they were already

133
00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:28.490
just the smallest amount that they
wanted to deal with, just half steps.

134
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:34.200
So we end up here within an octave,
we end up with 12 equal pitches.

135
00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:39.266
But we still use this term of seven note
scale, cuz we have seven notes within

136
00:08:39.266 --> 00:08:44.591
the scale of the major scale and seven
notes within the scale of the minor scale.
