2
00:00:06.212 --> 00:00:11.141
Our class video showed us how it came
about that we in the west have a seven

3
00:00:11.141 --> 00:00:13.040
pitch or seven note scale.

4
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.580
It was given to us by the ancient Greeks,
owing to their love for

5
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.740
mathematically pure musical intervals.

6
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.500
They used math to explain the entire
universe, including music.

7
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.541
The Greeks had several
different kinds of scales, and

8
00:00:27.541 --> 00:00:30.671
you heard all their funny names
there in the class video.

9
00:00:30.671 --> 00:00:33.379
And this held true for about 2,000 years.

10
00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:38.596
But by the 17th century, Western
musicians had reduced these down to just

11
00:00:38.596 --> 00:00:43.587
two kinds of seven pitch patterns,
a major pattern and a minor pattern.

12
00:00:43.587 --> 00:00:46.879
The major pattern went this way.

13
00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:52.753
[MUSIC]

14
00:00:52.753 --> 00:00:54.378
And the minor this way.

15
00:00:54.378 --> 00:00:59.837
[MUSIC]

16
00:00:59.837 --> 00:01:03.060
Each follows a particular pattern
of steps on the keyboard.

17
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.430
You can look all this up in your textbook
to see what the two patterns are.

18
00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.310
Whole and half steps.

19
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.690
The smallest distances on the keyboard.

20
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.300
But the important thing
is to hear the keyboard.

21
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.546
And hear the major and
minor when played on the keyboard.

22
00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:21.171
[MUSIC]

23
00:01:21.171 --> 00:01:21.922
Major.

24
00:01:21.922 --> 00:01:26.086
[MUSIC]

25
00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:31.290
Ever notice on a piano that we have two
pitches that sound rather identical?

26
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.837
Almost,

27
00:01:31.837 --> 00:01:33.171
[MUSIC]

28
00:01:33.171 --> 00:01:33.962
The same thing.

29
00:01:33.962 --> 00:01:40.879
[MUSIC]

30
00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:42.421
If we start on this pitch.

31
00:01:42.421 --> 00:01:45.296
[MUSIC]

32
00:01:45.296 --> 00:01:49.795
Go up and down the scale,
we get that arrangement.

33
00:01:49.795 --> 00:01:50.588
If we start here,

34
00:01:50.588 --> 00:01:51.255
[MUSIC]

35
00:01:51.255 --> 00:01:55.254
A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H.

36
00:01:55.254 --> 00:01:56.671
No we don't have Hs.

37
00:01:56.671 --> 00:01:57.496
Why don't we have Hs?

38
00:01:57.496 --> 00:01:59.796
[MUSIC]
A-B-C-D-E-F-G.

39
00:01:59.796 --> 00:02:04.129
Because this is duplicating,
in essence, the one down below.

40
00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:05.711
Octave duplication.

41
00:02:05.711 --> 00:02:08.643
[MUSIC]
The eighth note is the same as the first.

42
00:02:08.643 --> 00:02:11.860
Therefore the eighth note's
simply called the octave.

43
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.090
You know about octaves.

44
00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.110
You've been hearing them all of your life.

45
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.610
I'm gonna sing a pitch.

46
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.171
And you're going to sing the octave above.

47
00:02:19.171 --> 00:02:20.504
I'll do one first and then you do one.

48
00:02:20.504 --> 00:02:21.711
I'll take this.

49
00:02:21.711 --> 00:02:27.420
[SOUND] Okay, now you do one.

50
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.212
[MUSIC]

51
00:02:30.212 --> 00:02:30.712
There we go.

52
00:02:30.712 --> 00:02:33.671
[MUSIC]

53
00:02:33.671 --> 00:02:34.921
That's right.

54
00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:39.503
[SOUND] So we have the octave in our ear.

55
00:02:39.503 --> 00:02:44.120
This is the two to one ratio that we
discussed before, in our first session.

56
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.060
The upper pitch,
the octave above is vibrating.

57
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.000
My vocal chords here
are vibrating twice as fast.

58
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.463
[SOUND] As the lower octave.

59
00:02:53.463 --> 00:02:58.629
[SOUND] The eighth pitch of the scale
duplicates the first pitch.

60
00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:02.129
Eight and one are the same and thereafter
all of the intervals are the same.

61
00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:07.170
[MUSIC]

62
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.694
The intervals In that higher octave that
I just played are exactly the same as

63
00:03:11.694 --> 00:03:13.060
the lower one.

64
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.528
For this reason we have only
seven letter names in the scale.

65
00:03:16.528 --> 00:03:24.560
A-B-C-D-E-F-G, no, H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P,
because we start all over again.

66
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.602
This is the phenomenon
of octave duplication.

67
00:03:27.602 --> 00:03:30.430
And it is part of nature not nurture.

68
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.245
Octave duplication is at work in
musical cultures around the globe.

69
00:03:35.245 --> 00:03:39.550
Whether in Chinese music, Indian music,
Indonesian music or African music.

70
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.370
So we in the west have
a major scale pattern and

71
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.440
a minor scale pattern,
each with seven different pitches.

72
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.220
But the distance between the adjacent
pitches in those two scales

73
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.460
is not the same.

74
00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.000
The major and minor scales involve
two different sequences of intervals.

75
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.660
Again, an interval of music is simply
the distance from one pitch to another.

76
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.360
In each major and minor scale
there are five adjacent intervals

77
00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.710
that we call whole tones and
two intervals of half tones or half steps.

78
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.629
Think of the scale as a ladder with rungs,
but

79
00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:20.578
as you go up the ladder five of
the rungs are a foot apart and

80
00:04:20.578 --> 00:04:23.796
two rungs are just six inches apart.

81
00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:26.030
So here are our ladders and
they're irregular.

82
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.370
But if they are irregular blame

83
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.850
the ancient Greeks who put
mathematics ahead of symmetry.

84
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.030
Why is this important?

85
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.300
This whole and half step business?

86
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.050
This idea of rungs of different
sizes within the scale?

87
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.360
Well, it's because of the position
of the half steps within the scale

88
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.890
that makes the major scale
sound the way it does and

89
00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.579
makes the minor scale
sound the way it does.

90
00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.212
Here is the beginning of
the major scale ladder.

91
00:04:58.212 --> 00:04:59.754
[MUSIC]

92
00:04:59.754 --> 00:05:04.046
And here's the beginning
of the minor scale ladder.

93
00:05:04.046 --> 00:05:05.212
[MUSIC]

94
00:05:05.212 --> 00:05:09.138
All major scales sound the same way
because they have the same pattern of

95
00:05:09.138 --> 00:05:10.390
whole and half steps.

96
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.770
All minor scales sound the same way for
the same reason.

97
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.980
We can begin a major scale, or a minor
scale, on any pitch of the keyboard.

98
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.012
We can move the pattern,
transpose the pattern, as it is called,

99
00:05:22.012 --> 00:05:23.670
to begin on another pitch.

100
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:32.005
[MUSIC]

101
00:05:32.005 --> 00:05:35.030
Scales are extremely important
when listening to music.

102
00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.300
Far more so than we realize.

103
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.680
We've grown up with scales.

104
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.610
Even if you've never had a moment
of instruction in music theory and

105
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.700
you've never heard of the idea
of major scale before today,

106
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.750
I could prove to you that
know a great deal, a lot,

107
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.600
about scales because you've been
hearing them all your life.

108
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.770
So I'm gonna begin to play here,
and you finish off a major scale.

109
00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:56.920
So here we go.

110
00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.540
La, la, la,

111
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:06.171
la, la, la.

112
00:06:06.171 --> 00:06:06.796
See there?

113
00:06:06.796 --> 00:06:07.379
Good.

114
00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:08.420
You did it.
