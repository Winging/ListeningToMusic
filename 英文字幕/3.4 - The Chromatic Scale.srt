2
00:00:08.857 --> 00:00:12.250
Finally, there's a third
type of scale in the west.

3
00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.730
One that is neither major, nor minor.

4
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.600
It's the chromatic scale.

5
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.290
Instead of using just seven
pitches within the octave,

6
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.965
the chromatic scale uses
all 12 possible pitches.

7
00:00:22.965 --> 00:00:25.080
Well, wait a minute, you say,

8
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.910
I thought we only had seven pitches
in the scale that the Greeks gave us.

9
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.520
That's basically true.

10
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.295
But in the course of time,
particularly during the 14th century,

11
00:00:34.295 --> 00:00:38.780
the rungs of what we call
the white keys of the keyboard.

12
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.829
The whole steps came to be filled
in with additional half steps.

13
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.300
Here you can see them being filled in.

14
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.234
Notice that the two short rungs of the
ladder couldn't be filled in between E and

15
00:00:55.234 --> 00:00:56.131
F, and B and C.

16
00:00:56.131 --> 00:01:00.730
Those are those little gaps that
we heard about in the class video.

17
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.350
They couldn't be filled in
because there was no space.

18
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.280
So we had seven pitches initially and
gradually added five more.

19
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.820
Here, the black keys, to get us to
the total of 12 that we have today.

20
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.660
Okay, back to the chromatic scale.

21
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:23.420
The Greek word chroma,
from whence we get chromatic,

22
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.470
the Greek word chroma means simply color.

23
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.300
And indeed this is a colorful scale
because it has more pitches in it.

24
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.770
On the screen you see
an ascending chromatic scale

25
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.830
with the added pitches
indicated by a sharp sign.

26
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.615
Below, let me play that

27
00:01:43.615 --> 00:01:47.098
[MUSIC]

28
00:01:47.098 --> 00:01:50.255
So that's the ascending chromatic scale.

29
00:01:50.255 --> 00:01:55.037
Below you see the well known
White Christmas written by Irving Berlin.

30
00:01:55.037 --> 00:02:05.034
[MUSIC]

31
00:02:05.034 --> 00:02:07.715
Notice that it's only
the beginning of White Christmas.

32
00:02:07.715 --> 00:02:14.877
[MUSIC]

33
00:02:14.877 --> 00:02:17.100
That is chromatic.

34
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.510
Indeed, only very rarely
is an entire piece written

35
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.540
in the chromatic scale
from beginning to end.

36
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.420
Usually it's just a portion of
the piece that's chromatic.

37
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.361
Irving Berlin begins here,
as we heard with chromaticism and

38
00:02:30.361 --> 00:02:32.647
then returns to a rising major scale

39
00:02:32.647 --> 00:02:38.730
[MUSIC]

40
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.990
Chromaticism adds richness, and
it can add tension to the music.

41
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.291
Here's how Mozart used chromaticism and

42
00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:50.920
the chromatic scale in his
Requiem Mass to build tension.

43
00:02:50.920 --> 00:03:00.920
[MUSIC]

44
00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:12.362
So here he was coming up the scale,
minor scale,

45
00:03:12.362 --> 00:03:17.149
then last little bit is all chromatic.

46
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.040
Here's how Beethoven used
chromaticism going the other way.

47
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.946
Coming down the scale.

48
00:03:30.946 --> 00:03:40.268
[MUSIC]

49
00:03:40.268 --> 00:03:41.890
Descending a chromatic scale.

50
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.860
So that's what chromaticism does.

51
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.560
It adds richness, variety, and
often tension to the music.

52
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.057
Or it releases tension from the music.
