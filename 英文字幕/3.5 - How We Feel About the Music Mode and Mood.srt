[MUSIC]

2
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:13.200
Scales in music provide
an oral context for us.

3
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.390
They tell us where we are in the melody.

4
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.990
Oddly, most of the time when we listen
to music, we aren't aware of this scale.

5
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.670
Particularly those two little
half steps that are in the scale.

6
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:32.000
But a scale provides something akin to
a global positioning system for us.

7
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.520
A musical GPS for
recognizing where we are in a melody.

8
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.833
If I play or sing this for you,
You can sing the next note.

9
00:00:42.833 --> 00:00:49.474
[MUSIC]

10
00:00:49.474 --> 00:00:54.639
There, [SOUND].

11
00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:59.550
You've intuited that we have in this
little piece that we've created here.

12
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.510
A major scale and

13
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.968
you have intuited where we are in that
scale, indeed where we should go next.

14
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.280
To the bottom, at note one.

15
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.670
Using our scalar GPS,
we recognize the grid, the scale.

16
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.740
And we have oriented ourselves within it.

17
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.860
Indeed, when we listen to music,
our brain orients us automatically.

18
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.010
Because we've been brought up
with music that works this way.

19
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.040
We now process music instantaneously,
indeed

20
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.470
subconsciously because that's part of the
musical nurturing that we have received.

21
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.390
It's part of our musical template that
we talked about in our first session.

22
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.680
And a final point About
the scales that make up melodies.

23
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.150
Scales encourage us to feel
a particular way about the music.

24
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.640
Generally speaking in Western music, we
associate happy, bright sounds with major.

25
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.990
And sad, somber ones,
possibly exotic ones, with minor.

26
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.100
And we've been doing this
since the 16th century.

27
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.544
Here's a piece by Robert Schumann.

28
00:02:04.544 --> 00:02:09.442
[MUSIC]

29
00:02:09.442 --> 00:02:11.420
It's called The Merry Farmer.

30
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.124
Here's one, as we heard, by Chopin.

31
00:02:14.124 --> 00:02:21.472
[MUSIC]

32
00:02:21.472 --> 00:02:24.380
Major happy, minor sad.

33
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.980
But there's nothing in the physics
of music that causes this to be so.

34
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.230
Indeed it's culture.

35
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.040
I recently spent a week in Poland,
in Krakow, Poland, and

36
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.770
I was surprised to find how
many of the dance tunes,

37
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.990
the happy dance tunes of
the Polish people we in minor.

38
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.920
So it's not nature it's nurture.

39
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.983
Let's have a little fun here and
see if we can change things and

40
00:02:49.983 --> 00:02:54.878
if we change things up, how we can
change how we feel about the music.

41
00:02:54.878 --> 00:02:59.260
And we're gonna throw in a new term here,
we're gonna throw in the term mode.

42
00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.250
We have a major mode scale and
a minor mode scale.

43
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.950
So let's go back to our image now with the
scale of the major pattern on the left,

44
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.970
labeled major mode, and
the scale of the minor on the right.

45
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.580
Notice the bottom left that
the major mode has a large interval

46
00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.439
at the very beginning.

47
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.800
And that the minor mode has
a smaller one at the beginning.

48
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.060
That's why the french who first coined
the terms majeur and mineur in the 17th

49
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:36.260
century called this one on the left
the larger, major, majeur.

50
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.410
Here's a familiar happy tune.

51
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.110
But now it's been switched.

52
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.590
Well we'll make it switch here.

53
00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.866
So here we are with
the familiar holiday tune.

54
00:03:44.866 --> 00:03:48.069
[MUSIC]

55
00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.297
And now you can see at the arrow
I'm gonna switch it up.

56
00:03:51.297 --> 00:03:57.868
[MUSIC]

57
00:03:57.868 --> 00:04:00.460
Well not much joy there, how'd we do that?

58
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:05.550
Well, I just lowered the third
pitch of the scale by a half step,

59
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.180
changing it from the major
mode to the minor mode.

60
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.352
We can do the same thing
with You Are My Sunshine.

61
00:04:12.352 --> 00:04:20.270
[MUSIC]

62
00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:21.490
It doesn't sound very sunny.

63
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.093
Same thing with Happy Birthday.

64
00:04:23.093 --> 00:04:26.459
[MUSIC]

65
00:04:26.459 --> 00:04:28.760
That doesn't sound very happy.

66
00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:29.401
All we're doing there.

67
00:04:29.401 --> 00:04:30.817
[MUSIC]

68
00:04:30.817 --> 00:04:35.100
Just lowering that first
third of the scale.

69
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.310
So that first interval of a third in
the scale is very important in determining

70
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.140
the mode, major versus minor.

71
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:50.406
If we change the mode from major to minor,
we change the mood of the music entirely.
