2
00:00:06.914 --> 00:00:08.030
How do you create a great melody?

3
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:10.380
Well if I knew I wouldn't be sitting here.

4
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.100
I'd be on Broadway composing musicals or
in Hollywood writing films,

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.370
just shaking great music out of my sleeve.

6
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.990
Indeed, no one knows what
makes a great melody.

7
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.710
There's no magic formula.

8
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.650
And because of the number
of pitches in the scale and

9
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.040
the many rhythms to which they can be set,

10
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.530
there's an almost limitless number
of melodies that can be created.

11
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.120
Although there's no formula or recipe for

12
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.619
making a great melody, there are,
however, some commonalities among them.

13
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.460
Almost all melodies in western music,

14
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.590
as we have said, are written in
either a major or a minor mode.

15
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.380
All melodies have a sense of tonality,

16
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.290
they are organized around
a primary pitch or tone.

17
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.070
That primary pitch is called the tonic.

18
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.196
The tonic is always the first
note of the scale, and

19
00:01:01.196 --> 00:01:06.090
because of octave duplication,
it's also the last note of the scale.

20
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.250
We can go up to the tonic, or
we can come down to the tonic.

21
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.540
Up to eight down to one.

22
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.779
Here's a melody going up to eight,
an old Scottish folk song.

23
00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:23.610
[MUSIC]

24
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.440
You hear it going up to eight, the tonic.

25
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.591
Here's a melody where we go down,
down to the tonic.

26
00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:33.676
[MUSIC]

27
00:01:33.676 --> 00:01:35.000
So there we come down to the tonic.

28
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.550
When we make or we hear music,
we hear the tonic.

29
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.959
Here's twinkle, twinkle.

30
00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:47.136
[MUSIC]

31
00:01:47.136 --> 00:01:50.230
And of course we can all
sing that tonic pitch.

32
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.990
How is it that we feel or hear the tonic?

33
00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.472
We do so because subconsciously, again,
we are mapping a scale, either major or

34
00:02:00.472 --> 00:02:05.160
minor as we listen and instinctively
we know where we are in that scale.

35
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.310
And where it begins and
where it ends, on the tonic.

36
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.750
All melodies end on the tonic,
one way or another.

37
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.542
The word tonality, and the word key
are used interchangeably in music.

38
00:02:17.542 --> 00:02:20.880
I'm in the tonality of C,
I'm in the key of C.

39
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.060
Doesn't matter which you choose,
either way, you're using a scale, major or

40
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.390
minor, beginning on C.

41
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:35.010
So a scale, and a sense of the tonic of
the scale create a sense of tonality,

42
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.850
a general context for pitch,
a sonic landscape, if you will.
