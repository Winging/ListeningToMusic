00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.130
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:02.950
Round, Round get around, I get around.

3
00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.087
Yeah, get around,
round round, I get around,

4
00:00:05.087 --> 00:00:07.962
[MUSIC]

5
00:00:07.962 --> 00:00:09.594
>> Most pieces in pop music, most songs
are written in one tonality, or one key,

6
00:00:09.594 --> 00:00:10.620
and they stay there from beginning to end.

7
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.580
Most pieces in classical music,
however, change keys.

8
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.110
Because they're generally longer and
because we would become bored listening to

9
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.040
the same sound,
the same scale, all the time.

10
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.760
When music changes tonality,
or key, it's said to modulate.

11
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.920
Modulation is something akin to
a change of musical scenery.

12
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.290
We've moved to a different landscape or
a different soundscape.

13
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.921
Let me play some modulations here
on the piano, some quick ones.

14
00:00:40.921 --> 00:00:41.671
So we're in this particular key.

15
00:00:41.671 --> 00:00:49.587
[MUSIC]

16
00:00:49.587 --> 00:00:51.504
Now we're gonna modulate.

17
00:00:51.504 --> 00:00:58.587
[MUSIC]

18
00:00:58.587 --> 00:00:59.629
Now we're gonna modulate.

19
00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:07.253
[MUSIC]

20
00:01:07.253 --> 00:01:12.560
Now we're going to modulate,
and so on, and so on.

21
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.480
To demonstrate modulation in a piece
from the world of classical music,

22
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.700
by Aaron Copland.

23
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.790
And one from pop music; a great
piece by The Beach Boys.

24
00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.915
Let's turn to a class video, all right.

25
00:01:27.915 --> 00:01:33.345
We have one more idea to talk about and
that is the concept of key and modulation.

26
00:01:33.345 --> 00:01:34.129
Now this piece by U2.

27
00:01:34.129 --> 00:01:39.169
[MUSIC]

28
00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:41.592
Is written in a key, it's got a home key.

29
00:01:41.592 --> 00:01:43.595
It's an odd key, it's a B flat minor.

30
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.700
Five flats, b flat minor.

31
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.070
But it nonetheless is
a key the whole piece,

32
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.090
at least the vast majority of it,
is in that one key.

33
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.320
Occasionally, composers will change keys.

34
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.379
I was thinking I could play right before
you hear the Beethoven he starts.

35
00:02:00.379 --> 00:02:08.254
[MUSIC]

36
00:02:08.254 --> 00:02:11.005
So here we are in this minor key.

37
00:02:11.005 --> 00:02:18.463
[MUSIC]

38
00:02:18.463 --> 00:02:19.957
And here he is in a new key.

39
00:02:19.957 --> 00:02:21.785
This is a major key here.

40
00:02:21.785 --> 00:02:24.924
[SOUND] So composers do change keys, and

41
00:02:24.924 --> 00:02:29.879
when they change keys they affect
whats called a modulation.

42
00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:34.200
Let's listen to an example of,
I think we, do we have Copland up next?

43
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.300
Okay, let's listen to an example
of a pretty simple modulation

44
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.280
affected by Aaron Copland,
American composer.

45
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.238
Working in New York City in the 40's,
50's, 60's, and

46
00:02:45.238 --> 00:02:48.650
70's wrote a ballet suite
called Appalachian Spring.

47
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.440
And in it he has one section where he's
working through a series of variations on

48
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:59.670
a folk tune called A Gift to be Simple.

49
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.490
As he proceeds and I'll try to duplicate,

50
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.610
and go crazy up here at the piano at
the moment we get to the modulation.

51
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.980
Modulations are hard to hear,
modulations are hard to hear.

52
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.930
The only thing the best you can do with
it often times it's a, this is unsettled,

53
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.420
maybe it's modulating.

54
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.280
And I'm not even sure we would
ask you has the piece modulated.

55
00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.000
They're really kind of hard to hear,
but let's try, anyway.

56
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.587
So here's a Copland modulation.

57
00:03:28.587 --> 00:03:38.587
[MUSIC]

58
00:03:49.962 --> 00:03:52.690
So here he is in this key.

59
00:03:52.690 --> 00:04:02.690
[MUSIC]

60
00:04:12.755 --> 00:04:14.571
Pause it right there.

61
00:04:14.571 --> 00:04:17.321
I think this is where
the modulation comes,

62
00:04:17.321 --> 00:04:22.350
then he's gonna bring in the sitting on
this note, he brings in the trombone.

63
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.878
And then the trumpet
will jump off from there.

64
00:04:24.878 --> 00:04:26.589
[MUSIC]

65
00:04:26.589 --> 00:04:30.130
To a much higher, he was here.

66
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.510
And then it's modulated up to here.

67
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:41.254
So let's see if we can
hear this modulation now.

68
00:04:41.254 --> 00:04:51.904
[MUSIC]

69
00:04:51.904 --> 00:04:54.130
Here we go.
[MUSIC] I'm gonna pause it there.

70
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.890
So that's a modulation.

71
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.910
Conceptually, it's pretty straight
forward, but it's hard to hear.

72
00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.510
I think i've got one
that's easier to hear.

73
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.720
It's a piece I like to use
because it's just off the charts,

74
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.630
in terms of what other popular
music was doing at that time.

75
00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.510
It's a piece by the Beach Boys.

76
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.738
Beach Boys music is extremely interesting.

77
00:05:12.738 --> 00:05:16.990
Anything that California hear heads,
no, no, no.

78
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.060
This is really, musically,
just light years ahead of

79
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.340
what everybody else was doing in the,
I guess, late 50's and early 60's.

80
00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.178
So what I've got here on
the board is a harmonic scheme.

81
00:05:29.178 --> 00:05:33.119
And we're gonna, once again, for copyright
reasons, just take little chunks of this.

82
00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:40.260
But you can see that it's a piece
that changes, uses a lot of triads.

83
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.720
So every time you see a G up here that
means we have a chord built on G, and

84
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.400
a triad on E, triad on A,
triad on F, D, E.

85
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.430
And just looking at this,
this isn't shaping out to be 1451.

86
00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:53.920
So it's moving around a lot.

87
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.840
Then it gets to a section
where it does get very boring.

88
00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.740
It's very static at that particular point.

89
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.780
And then something of
interest will happen.

90
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.540
So let's listen to a little bit of this.

91
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:11.028
It's a piece in which there are contrasts
between sections of movement.

92
00:06:11.028 --> 00:06:18.328
With lot wild modulations and

93
00:06:18.328 --> 00:06:25.046
then sections of.

94
00:06:25.046 --> 00:06:35.046
[MUSIC]

95
00:06:37.671 --> 00:06:40.884
Here it gets very boring and
we are not gonna even listen to it.

96
00:06:40.884 --> 00:06:44.854
It's gonna sit there babum
babum babum babum babum babum.

97
00:06:44.854 --> 00:06:47.642
I'm really hip and
I'm having a great time, but

98
00:06:47.642 --> 00:06:50.960
then the text comes back to I get around.

99
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.485
So let's, I think

100
00:06:54.485 --> 00:07:00.780
that's why I've had to

101
00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.900
parse this thing out into a Frankenstein,
but let's listen to the next thing.

102
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.040
I think we go back to
the idea of I Get Around.

103
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.690
>> I get around.
My kinda town.

104
00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:05.520
Round, round, round, I get around.

105
00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.000
I'm a real cool head.
[MUSIC]

106
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.452
>> More boring

107
00:07:13.452 --> 00:07:17.970
stuff.

108
00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.416
More boring stuff at this point.

109
00:07:19.416 --> 00:07:24.515
But let's pick it up as we come to the end
of what I think is this boring stuff and

110
00:07:24.515 --> 00:07:27.233
we'll listen to what they do there.

111
00:07:27.233 --> 00:07:30.588
Go ahead.

112
00:07:30.588 --> 00:07:37.754
[MUSIC]

113
00:07:37.754 --> 00:07:42.130
So there sitting here,

114
00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:47.462
[MUSIC]

115
00:07:47.462 --> 00:07:50.546
So what kind of cadence
have they given us there?

116
00:07:50.546 --> 00:07:53.707
Deceptive cadence, deceptive cadence and

117
00:07:53.707 --> 00:07:57.130
that takes it up a half step,
and then it jumps.

118
00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:05.254
[MUSIC]

119
00:08:05.254 --> 00:08:09.620
As mentioned in class video, when we
listen to music, usually we hear or

120
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:14.340
sense that the music is modulating
to an new key or a new tonality.

121
00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:17.880
We don't usually know
where it's modulating to.

122
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:21.410
When I listen to music,
I often say oh, yes it's modulated.

123
00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:25.030
But where it's modulated
to I have no idea.

124
00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:25.930
To be able to say,

125
00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:30.360
oh well it's modulated from F major
to A major you have to have what?

126
00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:34.400
You'd have to have perfect pitch,
or absolute pitch.

127
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.480
Well, only one person in
approximately 10,000 has that.

128
00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:42.180
So for the rest of us the best we
can say is, hey, the tonality or

129
00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:43.398
key center has changed.

130
00:08:43.398 --> 00:08:50.087
We've modulated.
