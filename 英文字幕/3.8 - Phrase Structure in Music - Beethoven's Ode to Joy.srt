00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.505
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:08.980
When we communicate we do so
in sonic form.

3
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.490
Spoken words.

4
00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.632
If we want to record what we said or

5
00:00:12.632 --> 00:00:16.480
what we're thinking we can
write it down as words.

6
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.270
Strung together,
these individual words form phrases, and

7
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.370
taken together,
the individual phrases form larger units.

8
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.920
Sentences.

9
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.840
And sentences form paragraphs, and so on.

10
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.720
That's how language is constructed.

11
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.660
The same thing happens in
the language of music.

12
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.770
Pictures can be joined
to form musical phrases

13
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.970
that can be joined to flesh
out a complete melody.

14
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.980
To demonstrate this, we turn to
a simple melody, one from the famous

15
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.710
Broadway musical, Oklahoma, by Rodgers and
Hammerstein, Oh, What a Beautiful Morning.

16
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:49.990
Let's look at it.

17
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.900
Here we see the melody, and
we'll talk mostly about the melody here.

18
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.970
Next time we'll talk about the harmony.

19
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.769
So the melody is on top,
where we would expect it.

20
00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.070
The harmony is below in the chords
that are holding there.

21
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.350
The rhythm is in a meter, triple meter,
three-quarter notes to each measure.

22
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.130
The measures come in
symmetrical units 4 plus 4.

23
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.270
Two short phrases make a longer phrase.

24
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.480
One of eight measures.

25
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.060
Then come two more short
phrases that are similar but

26
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.720
not identical to the first eight.

27
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.180
Notice too that our melody
stays pretty much within

28
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.790
one octave with the tonic pitch,
on either end, high and low.

29
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.440
Finally, notice that the first long phrase

30
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.880
doesn't end on the tonic but
the second long phrase does.

31
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.100
The first long phrase opens the music,
the second

32
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.930
phrase closes it back down away home,

33
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.320
is another way of thinking
of this auditory experience.

34
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.220
Musicians, however,
tend to use a fancier term.

35
00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.610
Instead of a way home structure,
they say antecedent and

36
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.390
consequent phrase structure.

37
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.587
Let me play this for you.

38
00:02:14.587 --> 00:02:17.588
So here is our antecedent,
or our away phrase,

39
00:02:17.588 --> 00:02:24.878
[MUSIC]

40
00:02:24.878 --> 00:02:26.796
Not ending on the tonic.

41
00:02:26.796 --> 00:02:29.461
That's the end of the antecedent,
or away phrase.

42
00:02:29.461 --> 00:02:30.629
Let's go back home.

43
00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:39.004
[MUSIC]

44
00:02:39.004 --> 00:02:40.171
So there we are.

45
00:02:40.171 --> 00:02:42.780
Back home, and in the tonic.

46
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.910
But whatever you call it, a way home, or
antecedent consequent phrase structure.

47
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.620
This structure is quite common in music.

48
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.680
You hear it everywhere.

49
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.240
Be it in the Broadway show
tune that we just heard,

50
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.880
a pop song, or in a Beethoven symphony or
a Puccini aria.

51
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.120
As we'll hear shortly in
one of our later sessions.

52
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.950
Antecedent and consequent phrase structure
is endemic to melody in all Western music.

53
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.870
And one last point about melodies,
some are easy to sing, some are difficult.

54
00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.496
The New York Times recently ran a story
about the difficulty of singing

55
00:03:21.496 --> 00:03:25.337
the American national anthem,
the Star-Spangled Banner.

56
00:03:25.337 --> 00:03:28.475
At the beginning of sporting events,

57
00:03:28.475 --> 00:03:33.580
this is where we usually encounter
this in the United States.

58
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.850
What makes the Star Spangled Banner or
any melody difficult to sing?

59
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.960
Usually it's the amount of jumping
around in a melody that causes it to be

60
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.110
easy or difficult.

61
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.910
The more leaping or jumping,
the greater the difficulty.

62
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.730
Here's a very easy melody.

63
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.504
Easy because the pitches are one
right next to the other.

64
00:03:56.504 --> 00:04:04.580
[MUSIC]

65
00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:11.450
Here's a more difficult one in a different
kind of notation, a graphic notation.

66
00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.530
Actually, it's another Broadway show tune,

67
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.020
written in New York City in 1908 and
it's something of an anthem also.

68
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.680
An anthem for American baseball.

69
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.590
Take Me Out to the Ballgame.

70
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.754
Let's play that just to
remind you how it goes.

71
00:04:27.754 --> 00:04:32.671
[MUSIC]

72
00:04:32.671 --> 00:04:36.900
And you can see visually and
hear orally how difficult, or

73
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.740
how many jumps this thing has.

74
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:40.480
It's difficult.

75
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.680
But maybe we've heard it so

76
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.870
many times that we've just
gotten used to the difficulty.

77
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.620
Now let's look at this
visually by comparing

78
00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.820
Take Me Out To The Ball Game with
another well known melody, Ode to Joy.

79
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.750
Which Beethoven composed and
incorporated in his Ninth Symphony.

80
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.220
So here comes Ode To Joy.

81
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.004
And here's the way it goes,
I'm sure you know this too.

82
00:05:06.004 --> 00:05:13.340
[MUSIC]

83
00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:19.795
Notice there that all the pitches
are right next to each other.

84
00:05:19.795 --> 00:05:24.247
We call a melody with many leaps such as
Take Me Out To The Ball Game a disjunct

85
00:05:24.247 --> 00:05:25.040
melody.

86
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.950
We call one that moves smoothly up and
down the scale a conjunct melody.

87
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.180
Take Me Out To The Ball Game, disjunct.

88
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.560
Ode to Joy, conjunct.

89
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.560
Disjunct, conjunct.

90
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.390
The two melodies are very different.

91
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.280
But each has been with us for a long time.

92
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.480
In a way, each is a classic.

93
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.950
But both have a clear sense of scale and

94
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:53.910
a sense of the tonic and they are both
made up of units of four bar phrases.

95
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.810
And both involve antecedent and
consequent phrase structure.

96
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:04.540
But let's see how melodic phrase structure
plays out in this Beethoven melody.

97
00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:08.920
Again, we're going to stay with
the famous Beethoven Ode To Joy.

98
00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.240
Which today serves not as
the anthem of American baseball but

99
00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.250
as the anthem of the European Union.

100
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.790
And to do this we turn
now to a class video.

101
00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.960
>> So melodies can be conjunct or
disjunct.

102
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.380
And possibly the most conjunct of all
melodies [COUGH] in the history of music

103
00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:32.590
was the melody that we looked at very
briefly in the first gathering and

104
00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.830
that is Beethoven's famous Ode to Joy.

105
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:41.400
Now, once again, Beethoven was in his 50's
when he was working on his last symphony

106
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.970
or proved to be his last symphony.

107
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:44.319
His ninth symphony and

108
00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:49.797
he'd been tinkering with this particular
melody all the way back to, probably 1803.

109
00:06:49.797 --> 00:06:51.878
So it's about 20 years or so.

110
00:06:51.878 --> 00:06:55.450
The ninth symphony is 1823, '24.

111
00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:58.337
As early as 1823, we know he's working on

112
00:06:58.337 --> 00:07:00.671
>> [MUSIC]

113
00:07:00.671 --> 00:07:02.660
>> Trying to get this to work just right.

114
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.510
And eventually, over this 20 year period,
he did get it to work just right.

115
00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:08.212
Let me swing this board around.

116
00:07:12.462 --> 00:07:14.140
Here's the famous melody.

117
00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:18.660
I've put it in the key,
it's called the bass cleft here.

118
00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.090
And it's in a major key.

119
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:25.550
We don't need to know what the particular
notes are, but let's look at this just for

120
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:30.880
a moment because it works well
as a prototype of melody.

121
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.030
It does something that
a lot of melodies do.

122
00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:39.330
First of all, as you can see by
the trajectory here, it's very conjunct.

123
00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.020
Neighboring notes here.

124
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:46.720
If you look at the German in the text
it has to do with [FOREIGN].

125
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.520
Millions B embraced.

126
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.410
And this, I believe is the sort
of the national anthem for

127
00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:55.700
the United Nations, so this has to
be something that we can all sing.

128
00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.450
And if you have conjunct motion,
that makes it easier.

129
00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:01.650
It's also very symmetrical.

130
00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:03.610
As you can see, it's nothing but

131
00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:08.650
a pattern of four bars plus four
bars plus four bars plus four bars.

132
00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:11.340
And as we said before, music has a syntax.

133
00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:16.460
So that these phrases have to be arranged
in a particular way that makes sense.

134
00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:21.340
So we start out here with an opening
phrase, ya, ta, ta, ta,ti, ta, ta, ta, ta,

135
00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:24.010
ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, tam.

136
00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:25.550
Is that the tonic, ta tam?

137
00:08:27.285 --> 00:08:27.852
>> Down.

138
00:08:27.852 --> 00:08:30.504
>> Can anybody sing the tonic?

139
00:08:32.254 --> 00:08:34.754
>> Yeah, yeah, [SOUND].

140
00:08:34.754 --> 00:08:38.770
The tonic is actually over here,
it's a little bit lower than that.

141
00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:42.810
That was a really hard question,
I'm amazed anybody got it, good for you.

142
00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:46.230
So what happens here is this
opening phrase that we'll call A.

143
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:51.200
Musicians like to label stuff just with
alphabetical labels to keep it simple.

144
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.280
We'll call this phrase A.

145
00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.430
It sort of opens things up.

146
00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:57.022
And we refer to this as
the antecedent phrase.

147
00:08:57.022 --> 00:08:59.379
The next phrase, B,

148
00:08:59.379 --> 00:09:01.254
[MUSIC]

149
00:09:01.254 --> 00:09:02.046
is very similar.

150
00:09:02.046 --> 00:09:03.880
[MUSIC]

151
00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.671
But here it takes the deviation

152
00:09:05.671 --> 00:09:07.378
[MUSIC]

153
00:09:07.378 --> 00:09:10.170
and gets it back,
gets us back to the tonic.

154
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:13.570
Now we could walk out the door
at that point, right?

155
00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:15.500
We're feeling totally stable there.

156
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.460
We've got it all together for
the rest of the day.

157
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.830
However, it would be
a pretty short melody.

158
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:22.150
So what he then does
is write an extension.

159
00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:23.254
We'll call this C.

160
00:09:23.254 --> 00:09:29.656
[MUSIC]

161
00:09:29.656 --> 00:09:33.100
Very interesting, put an asterisk by this.

162
00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:37.180
Beethoven, in a way, saved this melody,
he rescued this melody

163
00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:42.180
which was in danger of becoming
excessively four square by doing what.

164
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.460
If I had been writing it.

165
00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:46.570
Da da da da da da da da.

166
00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.629
Da, da, da, da.

167
00:09:49.629 --> 00:09:53.129
What did Beethoven do here, we talked
about it last time, a rhythmic device?

168
00:09:54.297 --> 00:09:55.420
Syncopation.

169
00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:59.650
He brings his opening note,
that F sharp, in a beat early.

170
00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:04.260
This should, you would think, be a half
note and this would start on the down beat

171
00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:08.530
over here, but he brings, in effect, the
sound of the down beat in a beat early.

172
00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:12.290
Gives it a little bit of pep
there at that particular point.

173
00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:14.087
And then what is this here?

174
00:10:14.087 --> 00:10:19.671
[MUSIC]

175
00:10:19.671 --> 00:10:23.379
Well of course, it's a replication of B.

176
00:10:23.379 --> 00:10:25.600
We've got to end on the tonic.

177
00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:31.070
All pieces, classical or pop,
one way or the other end on the tonic.

178
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:31.790
Okay.

179
00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:38.840
So let's have us now, let me put
a fermata over this, let's all sing this.

180
00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:42.200
We don't have to read the notes,
you don't have to sing any text.

181
00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.570
We're just going to sing la.

182
00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:45.540
I'll conduct in four.

183
00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:46.462
So sit back

184
00:10:46.462 --> 00:10:49.670
[MUSIC]

185
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:52.240
Everybody vocally prepared here?

186
00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.638
Here we go.

187
00:10:53.638 --> 00:10:58.171
I'll give you one, two, ready, sing.

188
00:10:58.171 --> 00:11:03.803
La, la, la, la louder louder, la,

189
00:11:03.803 --> 00:11:09.091
la, la, la, la, la, la, good.

190
00:11:09.091 --> 00:11:13.879
La, la, la, la, la, la,
la la la la la la la la la.

191
00:11:13.879 --> 00:11:19.051
La, la, la, la, la, la,

192
00:11:19.051 --> 00:11:24.223
la, la, la, la, la, la,

193
00:11:24.223 --> 00:11:28.559
la, la, la, la, la.

194
00:11:28.559 --> 00:11:35.071
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,

195
00:11:35.071 --> 00:11:40.796
la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

196
00:11:40.796 --> 00:11:42.754
We'll put a big ritard on it there.

197
00:11:42.754 --> 00:11:44.266
So, we wanted to bang that syncopation,
and then of course,

198
00:11:44.266 --> 00:11:45.970
there's no sound on the downbeat
here to make the syncopation work.

199
00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:55.010
So that's the melody, seems very simple,
but it took Beethoven a long time to sort

200
00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:59.840
of iron all this out, make his perfect
melody, the prototypical melody, in a way.

201
00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:05.420
>> And contrary to what my Doppelganger
on the screen in that class video said,

202
00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:08.840
this is not the anthem
of the United Nations.

203
00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:12.240
It's the anthem of today's European Union.

204
00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:16.754
And indeed, it has a great deal to do
with the history of contemporary Europe.

205
00:12:16.754 --> 00:12:20.370
In 1989, the Berlin Wall fell.

206
00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:25.020
And the world, at least the free world,
[LAUGH] celebrated that event.

207
00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:28.160
And they celebrated it with
the music of Beethoven.

208
00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:32.420
And the principle conductor that was
brought to Europe at that time to lead

209
00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:36.740
this singing of the Ode to Joy around
Europe was actually an American,

210
00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:38.090
Leonard Bernstein.

211
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:42.040
So we're gonna end with
Leonard Bernstein conducting

212
00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:46.030
an orchestra in a German
speaking city of Vienna.

213
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:52.836
Just a portion of a professional
group singing Beethoven's Ode to Joy.

214
00:12:52.836 --> 00:13:02.836
