2
00:01:05.046 --> 00:01:07.212
Today we'll be talking about harmony.

3
00:01:07.212 --> 00:01:11.360
The piece you just heard was
the piano part a work by Beethoven.

4
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.180
It has a melody yes, but

5
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.410
the element that gives the music it's
richness is the accompanying harmony.

6
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.086
Here's the melody alone.

7
00:01:21.086 --> 00:01:29.754
[MUSIC]

8
00:01:29.754 --> 00:01:30.840
And so on.

9
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.080
It's fine, though the rhythm might
possibly be a little bit repetition.

10
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.088
But now here it is again with the harmony.

11
00:01:39.088 --> 00:01:49.088
[MUSIC]

12
00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:07.103
As Beethoven himself is
reported to have said in 1810,

13
00:02:07.103 --> 00:02:11.825
every thought in music is
ultimately related to the whole of

14
00:02:11.825 --> 00:02:15.046
the harmony which is oneness end quote.

15
00:02:15.046 --> 00:02:17.960
Well, here's a wildly different
way of thinking of it.

16
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.320
In the 1990s, a recruiting slogan for

17
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.000
the US Army famously said quote
be all that you can be end quote.

18
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.610
Harmony supports the melody and
allows it to be all that it can be.

19
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.300
Now here's another piece for
piano one by Chopin, a prelude by Chopin.

20
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.940
In the image on your screen you see
the melody in the red above, and

21
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.963
the harmony,
those are the notes underneath.

22
00:02:46.963 --> 00:02:51.171
Let me play that.

23
00:02:51.171 --> 00:03:01.171
[MUSIC]

24
00:03:22.795 --> 00:03:27.087
And so on.

25
00:03:27.087 --> 00:03:29.628
Melody above, harmony below.

26
00:03:29.628 --> 00:03:32.421
Chordial accompany below.

27
00:03:32.421 --> 00:03:36.050
Harmony seems to be very important
in music, and indeed it is.

28
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.750
But here's a question for you.

29
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.620
How many musical cultures around the world
do without harmony, almost entirely?

30
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.910
Actually most of them do without harmony,
or at least without much harmony.

31
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.080
Here's a rendering of the Adhan.

32
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.420
The Islamic call to prayer, sung around
the Muslim world five times a day.

33
00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.100
But it's done without any kind
of accompanying voices or

34
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.220
instruments, without any sort of harmony.

35
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:11.004
Let's just listen.

36
00:04:11.004 --> 00:04:21.004
[MUSIC]

37
00:04:41.588 --> 00:04:44.254
All of the beauty of this
music lies in the melody.

38
00:04:44.254 --> 00:04:48.255
And indeed in all the subtle
gradations between pitches and

39
00:04:48.255 --> 00:04:54.360
what the singer does by way of varying the
intensity when he has landed on a pitch.

40
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.490
In a situation such as this,
likely the addition of harmony

41
00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.390
would only obscure the chant and
obscure the beautiful melody.

42
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.370
Now some traditional music from Africa,
recorded in the country of Mali.

43
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.172
Again, there is little in the way
of accompanying harmony here.

44
00:05:11.172 --> 00:05:16.480
There's just a call and
response melody sung between two ladies,

45
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.712
with drums pushing the rhythm forward.

46
00:05:19.712 --> 00:05:29.712
[MUSIC]

47
00:05:39.087 --> 00:05:43.229
So some musical cultures,
particularly those that of the East,

48
00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:46.771
emphasize highly nuanced melody and
those of Africa and

49
00:05:46.771 --> 00:05:50.254
African influenced
South America emphasize rhythm.

50
00:05:50.254 --> 00:05:53.013
On the other hand, Western pop music and

51
00:05:53.013 --> 00:05:57.290
Western classical music
prefer these sorts of sounds.

52
00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.320
A melody plus a rich accompaniment.

53
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.620
Here's that Chopin prelude again.

54
00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.326
Actually in the 1970s pop
singer Barry Manilow turned

55
00:06:06.326 --> 00:06:09.962
this Chopin prelude into a pop hit,
It Could Be Magical.

56
00:06:09.962 --> 00:06:19.962
[MUSIC]

57
00:06:41.587 --> 00:06:43.796
And again, and so magical indeed.

58
00:06:43.796 --> 00:06:47.200
Magical because of the harmony.

59
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.830
Harmonies are built upon
simultaneously sounding

60
00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.910
aggregates of pitches called chords.

61
00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:59.490
A chord is simply a group of two or
more pitches sounding at the same time.

62
00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.570
Let's watch a class
video to see how chords,

63
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.050
specifically those chords called triads,
are built.

64
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:10.350
And how they form a foundation upon
which a melody can be constructed.

65
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:14.740
Let's talk for a moment about chords.

66
00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:15.420
What's a chord?

67
00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:22.580
Well a chord is just a simultaneous
sounding of two or more pitches.

68
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.410
That's a very basic,
general definition of a chord.

69
00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:31.781
And a chord can be,
of course [SOUND] consonant or

70
00:07:31.781 --> 00:07:34.879
it can be [SOUND] dissonant.

71
00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:37.712
So let's stick with just consonant chords.

72
00:07:37.712 --> 00:07:40.778
We'll be working with
consonant chords today and

73
00:07:40.778 --> 00:07:45.360
the most fundamental of the consonant
chords is this idea of the triad.

74
00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.090
This figure that we call the triad.

75
00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:55.350
It's the building block really of all our
harmonies whether it's pop or classical.

76
00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:58.380
And we're gonna use a lot
of pop music today and

77
00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:02.620
we'll be pointing out triads
there in this pop music.

78
00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:03.590
So what's a triad?

79
00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:06.930
Well, obviously you get the idea
of three pitches, three pitches.

80
00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:07.840
How does it work?

81
00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.800
Let's go over to the keyboard and
the staff here.

82
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.260
Let's say we've got a scale.

83
00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:19.690
And we do have a scale, C D E F G A B C,

84
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:25.570
and I wanted to construct a triad above
each of these notes of the scale.

85
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:29.320
Well, this happens to be a C,
middle C here.

86
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:34.880
So a triad is going to have three
pitches and it spans five letter names.

87
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.260
And we go one letter name,
two letter names, three letter names,

88
00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.650
four letter names, five letter names.

89
00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:41.300
We take one, three and five.

90
00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:46.830
Here I'm taking C, skipping D,
taking E, skipping F, taking G.

91
00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:49.710
And it gives me this three note aggregate.

92
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:54.921
Take one, skip, take one,
skip, take one, [SOUND].

93
00:08:54.921 --> 00:08:56.254
And we can do the same thing.

94
00:08:56.254 --> 00:09:04.337
[SOUND] And so on,
right up the scale in that fashion.

95
00:09:04.337 --> 00:09:06.930
Notice as we said before,
we've got this scale,

96
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:11.087
we've got some notes rather important
in the scale, tonic is very important.

97
00:09:11.087 --> 00:09:17.337
We said [SOUND] the leading tone is
important, so with chords and triads.

98
00:09:17.337 --> 00:09:19.560
Some are very important.

99
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.760
The tonic is very important and
this dominant.

100
00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.450
What we call the dominant.

101
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:26.250
It's not really the most important.

102
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:28.480
It sort of leads into,

103
00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:32.900
pulls into particularly
important setting up the tonic.

104
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:37.629
It's the next important,
right below that is the subdominant.

105
00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:46.020
It often pulls into the dominant which
then pulls into the tonic in that fashion.

106
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:49.504
So we would get this idea
of here's a chord here.

107
00:09:49.504 --> 00:09:53.504
[SOUND] There's the tonic,
here's the dominant, [SOUND].

108
00:09:53.504 --> 00:09:58.870
There's the subdominant,
[SOUND], and there's the tonic.

109
00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:00.540
We can flip this just a little bit.

110
00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:03.671
We could say alright
here's our tonic up here.

111
00:10:03.671 --> 00:10:07.630
[MUSIC]

112
00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:12.128
And go that way, tonic,
subdominant, dominant, tonic,

113
00:10:12.128 --> 00:10:17.588
[MUSIC]

114
00:10:17.588 --> 00:10:19.005
That way.

115
00:10:19.005 --> 00:10:21.910
So we could come up from the tonic,
or go down from the tonic.

116
00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:26.470
Generally speaking, composers are more
likely to go down from the tonic

117
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:31.320
than come back up to the tonic than
they are likely to go the other way.

118
00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.470
So we've got these three basic
chords we're gonna talk about.

119
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:37.161
There are others there that
we've built on the second and

120
00:10:37.161 --> 00:10:40.200
seventh degree of the scale, but
these are the most important.

121
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:46.067
And it's surprising how much music these
three basic chords can accommodate and

122
00:10:46.067 --> 00:10:47.629
with all the things.

123
00:10:47.629 --> 00:10:57.837
[MUSIC]

124
00:10:57.837 --> 00:10:58.462
Dominant, tonic, dominant, tonic, finally,

125
00:10:58.462 --> 00:11:01.879
[MUSIC]

126
00:11:01.879 --> 00:11:05.629
Subdominant tonic,

127
00:11:05.629 --> 00:11:06.537
[MUSIC],

128
00:11:06.537 --> 00:11:10.878
dominant, tonic.
[MUSIC]

129
00:11:10.878 --> 00:11:16.754
So a lot of music is made in that fashion.

130
00:11:16.754 --> 00:11:20.654
So as the class video said we get a lot
of musical mileage out of just these

131
00:11:20.654 --> 00:11:21.504
three chords.

132
00:11:21.504 --> 00:11:27.337
[MUSIC]

133
00:11:27.337 --> 00:11:30.629
So think about this the next time you
listen to music whether classical or pop.

134
00:11:30.629 --> 00:11:35.509
I think you can hear the very least of
difference between the dominant and

135
00:11:35.509 --> 00:11:36.796
the tonic chords.

136
00:11:36.796 --> 00:11:37.505
[MUSIC]

137
00:11:37.505 --> 00:11:41.920
Tonic, dominant, tonic, dominant, tonic.
