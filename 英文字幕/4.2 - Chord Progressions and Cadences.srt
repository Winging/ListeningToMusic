2
00:00:11.531 --> 00:00:14.596
Okay, so that's how chords work.

3
00:00:14.596 --> 00:00:20.340
Let's talk more about these triads,
those essential building blocks of music.

4
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.910
We have three primary triads, as said,
the tonic, built on the first degree,

5
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.260
the scale, the dominant build on
the fifth pitch of the scale, and

6
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.010
the subdominant built on the fourth
pitch or degree of the scale.

7
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.975
These chords account for a surprising
amount of the harmony that we hear.

8
00:00:36.975 --> 00:00:39.420
Let's take a common tune, Jingle Bells.

9
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.260
Let me just play Jingle Bells and keep
the chords steady underneath, the triads.

10
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:53.532
[MUSIC]

11
00:00:53.532 --> 00:00:57.394
Tonic.
[MUSIC]

12
00:00:57.394 --> 00:00:59.257
Subdominant.

13
00:00:59.257 --> 00:01:00.374
Tonic.

14
00:01:00.374 --> 00:01:01.858
[MUSIC]

15
00:01:01.858 --> 00:01:02.421
Dominant.

16
00:01:02.421 --> 00:01:04.562
Tonic.

17
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.700
So those triads keep changing
underneath the melody.

18
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.730
But why do they change
underneath the melody?

19
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.810
Why can't we just harmonize the melody
using one chord, one triad?

20
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.670
Well, if we did, here's what would happen.

21
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:28.969
[MUSIC]

22
00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:31.560
And so, doesn't really work, does it?

23
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.210
We violated one of our
rules of musical syntax.

24
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.080
Harmony must change to fit the melody.

25
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.250
As a melody moves through the pitches
of the scale, it moves in and

26
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.780
out of the pitches at different triads.

27
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.480
If a melody pitch is part of a triad,
we have a consonance.

28
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.840
But if it moves out of that triad,
then we heard a dissonance.

29
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.690
We have a dissonance.

30
00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.500
So the melody much change to be harmonious
with, sound good with the melody.

31
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.780
When triads change,
bringing a consonance support to a melody,

32
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.110
they build up a certain momentum,
they come in a purposeful way,

33
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.110
a purposeful march, that works in sync
with the direction of the melody.

34
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:22.000
Chords moving in this purposeful fashion
create what we call a chord progression.

35
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.850
They seem to pull along,
one to the next, moving toward and

36
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.408
eventually arriving at the tonic,
the tonic triad, the home triad.

37
00:02:30.408 --> 00:02:31.894
Let me play a chord progression.

38
00:02:31.894 --> 00:02:39.488
[MUSIC]

39
00:02:39.488 --> 00:02:44.800
So that's a very straightforward
chord progression.

40
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.610
The end of a chord progression
is called a cadence, a fall,

41
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.600
the final move, built possibly on
the fourth degree of the scale that

42
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.600
goes to the fifth degree of the scale
that ultimately moves to the tonic.

43
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.260
As you can see on the screen
here called four, five,

44
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.700
one or subdominant, dominant, tonic.

45
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.380
Same sort of thing.

46
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.030
Let me play that for you.

47
00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.330
[MUSIC]

48
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.310
So that's a cadence, a fall to the end.

49
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.380
Remember that flashy end of the opening
Richard Strauss's Zarathustra from our

50
00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.590
first session.

51
00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.730
It ends this way.

52
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:27.700
Remember this melody?

53
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.715
[MUSIC]

54
00:03:32.715 --> 00:03:34.385
But the final cadence goes,

55
00:03:34.385 --> 00:03:42.014
[MUSIC]

56
00:03:42.014 --> 00:03:46.271
That's just another cadence,
another end of the musical phrase,

57
00:03:46.271 --> 00:03:49.850
end of a passage with a chord progression.

58
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:55.081
Often in classical music,
the composer will signal the termination

59
00:03:55.081 --> 00:04:00.687
of a piece by alternating five and
one triad, dominant and tonic triads.

60
00:04:00.687 --> 00:04:04.077
It's a very simple cadence, goes this way.

61
00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:11.305
[MUSIC]

62
00:04:11.305 --> 00:04:12.190
Something like that.

63
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.900
The end, the end, the end.

64
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.440
You might just as well hold up a sign.

65
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.460
Hold up a sign like this.

66
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.480
The end.

67
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.140
So you can have a visual
sign that conveys meaning.

68
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.270
These letters allow us to generate
a sound that conveys meaning.

69
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.200
A word is part of a language.

70
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.360
Or you can have a musical sign
that also conveys meaning.

71
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.930
Music, too, is a language of music.

72
00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:43.880
The end.

73
00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.450
This kind of fifth degree to
tonic degree or one degree, five,

74
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:57.100
one cadence moving tonic to
dominant again or subdominant,

75
00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.830
dominant, tonic is called
an authentic cadence and

76
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:08.790
is most common in Western classical music
and equally common in Western pop music.

77
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.710
Here's another kind of cadence,
it's called a deceptive cadence.

78
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.755
Here the composer fools you,

79
00:05:16.755 --> 00:05:21.625
makes you think that you're going
to go home to the basic tonic.

80
00:05:21.625 --> 00:05:25.545
But he sort of kidnaps you and takes you
away somewhere else by substituting at

81
00:05:25.545 --> 00:05:30.625
the last moment another point of arrival
for the tonic that you expected.

82
00:05:30.625 --> 00:05:33.710
Let me play a deceptive cadence here for
you.

83
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.104
Let's see.

84
00:05:35.104 --> 00:05:45.605
[MUSIC]

85
00:05:45.605 --> 00:05:47.466
Oh, that wasn't expected.

86
00:05:47.466 --> 00:05:48.719
Or it could go,

87
00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:58.719
[MUSIC]

88
00:05:59.809 --> 00:06:02.530
Oh, that was even more unexpected.

89
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.910
So although you've been
aurally kidnapped here,

90
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:13.520
spirited away somewhat unexpectedly to
a new musical chord, there's good news.

91
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.270
You will be rescued.

92
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.530
A piece that moves to a deceptive
cadence invariably will

93
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.600
work its way back to the tonic.

94
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.670
After the deception,

95
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:26.580
the piece has to keep on going until it
reaches some kind of authentic cadence.

96
00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.500
Almost all music has this
kind of happy ending.

97
00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.590
Having been deceived by the musical world,

98
00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:36.580
the musical traveler must
now arrive back at home.

99
00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.865
So after a deceptive cadence,

100
00:06:38.865 --> 00:06:47.958
[MUSIC]

101
00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:48.933
Maybe continuing.

102
00:06:48.933 --> 00:06:53.512
[MUSIC]

103
00:06:53.512 --> 00:06:56.940
Ending up with some sort
of authentic cadence.

104
00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:03.980
There's a third kind of cadence to which
we apply the nickname amen because it's

105
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:10.930
used in much religious music, particularly
music of the hymns of the church,

106
00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:15.180
the ending of hymns, and
hymns in universities as well.

107
00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.890
They're sung at commencement or whatever.

108
00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:22.450
An amen cadence is one that
you'll likely recognize.

109
00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:26.452
It moves from a chord build on the fourth
degree of the scale to one built on

110
00:07:26.452 --> 00:07:28.174
the first degree of the scale.

111
00:07:28.174 --> 00:07:38.671
[MUSIC]

112
00:07:38.671 --> 00:07:42.440
And you can here people
singing the Hebrew word amen.

113
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.970
Finally, the last of our four
cadence types, the half cadence.

114
00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:54.858
Here the music just seems to stop,
specifically on a dominant chord.

115
00:07:54.858 --> 00:07:57.787
The music seems suspended,
but at the same,

116
00:07:57.787 --> 00:08:00.640
it implies that we have to move on more.

117
00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.390
Maybe we should call it
then a pause cadence

118
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:05.570
because that's really what it wants to do.

119
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:08.820
It pauses momentarily freezing the action.

120
00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.290
Hold it right there, and then it moves on.

121
00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:12.510
Let me play a half cadence.

122
00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:15.695
Let me see if I can find that
Beethoven that we heard earlier.

123
00:08:15.695 --> 00:08:19.271
So here's the Beethoven,
he's coming along.

124
00:08:19.271 --> 00:08:30.265
[MUSIC]

125
00:08:30.265 --> 00:08:31.385
And you want to hear,

126
00:08:31.385 --> 00:08:35.172
[MUSIC]

127
00:08:35.172 --> 00:08:36.199
And indeed, he gives us that.

128
00:08:36.199 --> 00:08:40.000
But that moment we pause there, that's
a half cadence, that's a pause cadence.

129
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:46.570
So let's review, with me playing
a standard chord progression.

130
00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:50.740
Indeed, the Pachelbel Canon Harmony, and

131
00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:55.220
I'll work through all four cadential
types in one way or another.

132
00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.098
Let me try this.

133
00:08:56.098 --> 00:08:59.310
What key?

134
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:00.386
Let's try this key.

135
00:09:00.386 --> 00:09:10.386
[MUSIC]

136
00:09:11.709 --> 00:09:14.695
Mm.
Well, that would be our deceptive cadence.

137
00:09:14.695 --> 00:09:15.630
We could try it again.

138
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:25.630
[MUSIC]

139
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.504
Just stop there, and that would be
our pause cadence, our half cadence.

140
00:09:33.504 --> 00:09:35.410
Or we could continue on.

141
00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:44.337
[MUSIC]

142
00:09:44.337 --> 00:09:48.937
Come back home, that'd be our
authentic cadence, or we could go,

143
00:09:48.937 --> 00:09:58.937
[MUSIC]

144
00:10:04.174 --> 00:10:08.570
So cadences have their own
emotional vibe to them.

145
00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:12.844
But they also help tell you
where you are in the music.

146
00:10:12.844 --> 00:10:14.841
If you hear this,

147
00:10:14.841 --> 00:10:19.898
[MUSIC]

148
00:10:19.898 --> 00:10:20.918
Or this.

149
00:10:20.918 --> 00:10:30.738
[MUSIC]

150
00:10:30.738 --> 00:10:33.126
You know darn well that you're at the end.
