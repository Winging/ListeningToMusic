[MUSIC]

2
00:00:18.774 --> 00:00:23.754
>> In the background,
you hear playing another famous melody,

3
00:00:23.754 --> 00:00:31.334
the aria O Meo Babino Caro, from
Giacomo Puccini's opera premiered in 1918.

4
00:00:31.334 --> 00:00:35.064
It's been used in many ways,
as a background score for

5
00:00:35.064 --> 00:00:38.150
TV commercials, films and the like.

6
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.290
It's a favorite, not only of opera lovers,
but of video game lovers too.

7
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.640
It was the background music for

8
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.630
the first edition of Grand Theft Auto,
of all things.

9
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.660
But why this popularity?

10
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.920
Let's take a look at it.

11
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.760
I'm going to simplify and at the same
time switch to a concert grand.

12
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.628
All right, let's have a demonstration
now with the four cadence types we

13
00:01:02.628 --> 00:01:03.759
have been discussing.

14
00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:09.459
Authentic, half cadence,
deceptive cadence and amen cadence and

15
00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:15.395
we're going to do it in a famous area
from an Opera by Puccini [FOREIGN].

16
00:01:15.395 --> 00:01:19.192
So let's start here, you know the melodies
I'll use all different sorts of

17
00:01:19.192 --> 00:01:20.509
things around the world.

18
00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:30.509
[MUSIC]

19
00:01:32.949 --> 00:01:37.220
So here we are at the end of the first
phrase ending on a half cadence.

20
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.250
Well the half cadence we're not settled.

21
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.040
We want to be here.

22
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.260
So we're singing here.

23
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.180
That requires of course
that the melody continue.

24
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:55.180
[MUSIC]

25
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.479
And we expect it to go here but
that's not what he does.

26
00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:05.499
What he does is this.

27
00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:08.779
[MUSIC]

28
00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:12.949
See there, now when we have a deceptive
table set it requires that we push on,

29
00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:17.245
we can't end here, we gotta end back on
the time, we gotta do as they would say in

30
00:02:17.245 --> 00:02:21.449
the airplane world, we gotta do a flyover,
so here comes a musical flyover.

31
00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:31.449
[MUSIC]

32
00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:38.259
Now we are back home on our timing.

33
00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:41.570
And he is not quite satisfied with that,
he's going to extended it

34
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.960
just a little bit, orchestra comes in,
then the voice comes back

35
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:54.960
[MUSIC]

36
00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:00.109
So notice there at the end
we get our amen cadence.

37
00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:04.699
[MUSIC]

38
00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:06.819
So again, couple things to note here.

39
00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.519
First, our traditional, antecedent and
consequent phrase structure.

40
00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:17.439
[MUSIC]

41
00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:20.260
That's the antecedent,
opens things up, we go away.

42
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.440
Now we gotta pull that back in,
come back home.

43
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:32.841
[MUSIC]

44
00:03:32.841 --> 00:03:36.049
but surprise there's a deceptive cadence,
you've got to push on then.

45
00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:41.699
[MUSIC]

46
00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:44.179
And we could stop there,
but he doesn't allow us.

47
00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:46.999
To do that he wants to extend
it just a bit further.

48
00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:52.239
[MUSIC]

49
00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.380
With that amen sound.

50
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.560
And there's a reason for that.

51
00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.739
Has to do with the text.

52
00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.770
And we'll explain that back in the studio.

53
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.970
Why the Amen Cadence there at the end?

54
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.040
The sound of the church at the end?

55
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.470
Well it works well with
the notion of a need for mercy.

56
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.430
Have mercy.

57
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:18.310
Hear the character [FOREIGN] the soprano
voice, is asking her father for mercy.

58
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.490
The words at the end
are oh father have pity.

59
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:21.070
Have pity.

60
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.695
[FOREIGN] We can even think of the,
be atop Michael Angelo's in St.

61
00:04:24.695 --> 00:04:26.220
Peter's in Rome.

62
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.220
So, a religious ending here.

63
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.080
An Amen ending might be
entirely appropriate.

64
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.760
Obviously, this is a beautiful melody.

65
00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.110
But the rich harmonies and

66
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.990
the varied cadences, they too also
make this an effective composition.

67
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.650
A classical favorite as we've said.

68
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:54.430
This is a quick analysis of this famous
aria, but let me make one final point.

69
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.500
When we analyze music we have a tendency
to suck all the joy out of it.

70
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.890
And we don't want to forget
that this is beauty,

71
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.660
there is much beauty in this music and
we should focus on that.

72
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.320
Analysis of the sort
we've been doing here,

73
00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:15.030
is just a help mate to understanding
how the beauty is created.

74
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:20.310
In truth, when we listen, there
are three kinds of listening that go on.

75
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.850
Analytical listening, technical listening,
and emotional listening.

76
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.050
First, analytical listening.

77
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.670
Simply said, what's going on?

78
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.860
Well that's what we just worked through
with our quick analysis of the harmony and

79
00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.380
the cadences in the Puccini aria.

80
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.200
Then there's the technical.

81
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.460
How well's it going?

82
00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:41.940
How are the performers doing?

83
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.870
In this case,
how well is the singer singing?

84
00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.760
And then, finally, there is the emotional.

85
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.850
How do I feel about the music and
the performance of it?

86
00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:57.690
We won't, mustn't forget this
latter element, the emotional.

87
00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.880
These are gorgeous sounds in
this aria by Puccini, and

88
00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.690
we mustn't be afraid to say just that.

89
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.570
So let's listen to this beautiful aria
one last time, just for pleasure.

90
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:14.921
You can find you favorite recording
of it on YouTube or iTunes, Spotify,

91
00:06:14.921 --> 00:06:20.015
but let me start by playing mine
with the incomparable Renee Fleming,

92
00:06:20.015 --> 00:06:22.019
singing O Meo Babino Caro.

93
00:06:22.019 --> 00:06:23.879
Enjoy.

94
00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:33.879
