[MUSIC]

2
00:00:11.717 --> 00:00:16.001
As we have seen, just as we have major and
minor scales so to we have major and

3
00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:17.670
minor triads.

4
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.300
Let's review just for a moment.

5
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.580
Let's create a C Major Scale.

6
00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.850
Scale beginning on the pitch C.

7
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.750
Now, let's add some thirds to it,
intervals of thirds.

8
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.690
Above each of these
pitches to create triads.

9
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.330
All of the triads build
upon the scale with

10
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.500
one exception that we need not go into,
is either a major or a minor triad.

11
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.590
Here's what they look
like now on a keyboard.

12
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.180
Major on top, minor beneath it.

13
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:56.944
Notice that we have two perimeter pitches,
the outer edges, the outer pitches.

14
00:00:56.944 --> 00:00:59.618
And it's really only the center pitch,

15
00:00:59.618 --> 00:01:03.325
the middle note that varies
from one triad to the other.

16
00:01:03.325 --> 00:01:05.211
To create a minor triad for

17
00:01:05.211 --> 00:01:09.990
example we simply move the middle
pitch down a half step.

18
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.305
Move it, in this case, from E down to
E flat, as you can see by the arrows.

19
00:01:15.305 --> 00:01:19.074
[MUSIC]

20
00:01:19.074 --> 00:01:22.285
But the immediate shift between major and

21
00:01:22.285 --> 00:01:26.475
minor triads is something
of a sensual sensation.

22
00:01:26.475 --> 00:01:28.135
It's sensational.

23
00:01:28.135 --> 00:01:29.983
Play this again, this way.

24
00:01:29.983 --> 00:01:31.740
[MUSIC]

25
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.565
Or, this way.

26
00:01:32.565 --> 00:01:36.045
[MUSIC]

27
00:01:36.045 --> 00:01:39.545
Composers have recognized
this over the centuries.

28
00:01:39.545 --> 00:01:43.952
One of the best examples is to be found
in a piece by the American composer

29
00:01:43.952 --> 00:01:44.766
John Adams.

30
00:01:44.766 --> 00:01:48.957
We'll deal with the music of Adams at
the end of our course when we get to

31
00:01:48.957 --> 00:01:50.889
modernism and post modernism.

32
00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:58.620
But for now let's just listen to what he
does in a work called Black Gondolas.

33
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.830
It was inspired -- Adams
piece was inspired,

34
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.500
by the 19th century Composer Franz Liszt.

35
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.530
Who in turn was inspired by
the image of a black coffin

36
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.070
that of his son-in-law
composer Ricard Wagner.

37
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.815
When Wagner's body was transported
from Venice back to Germany in 1883,

38
00:02:18.815 --> 00:02:22.568
a long story we don't need
to go into in any detail.

39
00:02:22.568 --> 00:02:25.689
Anyway, let's just listen to
the rocking of the gondola here.

40
00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:29.133
We'll perceive it that way
because of the rocking,

41
00:02:29.133 --> 00:02:34.420
or at least the alternation back and
forth between major and minor triads.

42
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.503
Again, John Adams, Black Gondolas.

43
00:02:37.503 --> 00:02:43.557
[MUSIC]

44
00:02:43.557 --> 00:02:47.407
Major, minor,

45
00:02:47.407 --> 00:02:51.257
major, minor,

46
00:02:51.257 --> 00:02:56.482
changes pitch level,

47
00:02:56.482 --> 00:03:01.709
major, minor Major.

48
00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:02.415
Minor.

49
00:03:02.415 --> 00:03:05.523
Again, another pitch level change.

50
00:03:05.523 --> 00:03:07.805
Major, and so on.

51
00:03:07.805 --> 00:03:17.805
[MUSIC]

52
00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.919
Very beautiful.

53
00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:30.770
But it's really just built on
the alternation of major and minor triad.

54
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.260
This same emotional tug-of-war,
this yin and yang between major and

55
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.640
minor, can also be felt in
a famous piece by Beethoven.

56
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.890
The first movement of
his Moonlight Sonata.

57
00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.355
You see the score on this screen.

58
00:03:47.184 --> 00:03:52.460
Beethoven has written a melody and
an accompanying harmony.

59
00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.120
But instead of playing the accompanying
harmony as block chords,

60
00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.840
block triads,
he plays the notes in succession.

61
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.587
Playing the notes of a chord in
succession instead of all at once creates

62
00:04:05.587 --> 00:04:10.187
what's called an arpeggio,
derived from the Italian word, arpa.

63
00:04:10.187 --> 00:04:13.127
Harps do a lot of this sort of thing,
arpeggio.

64
00:04:13.127 --> 00:04:14.717
Let me play one for you.

65
00:04:14.717 --> 00:04:18.743
[MUSIC]

66
00:04:18.743 --> 00:04:25.866
So to be here, but we can spin
out these notes as an arpeggio.

67
00:04:25.866 --> 00:04:32.815
And that's what Beethoven does at
the beginning of his 'Moonlight Sonata'.

68
00:04:32.815 --> 00:04:40.002
[MUSIC]

69
00:04:40.002 --> 00:04:43.727
And so on.

70
00:04:43.727 --> 00:04:49.086
But these sounds of Beethoven deserve
the richness of an old Steinway piano,

71
00:04:49.086 --> 00:04:50.742
so let's turn to that.

72
00:04:50.742 --> 00:05:00.742
[MUSIC]

73
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.345
Towards the end of the passage,

74
00:05:30.345 --> 00:05:33.970
you get a sense of what Beethoven
might have been intending.

75
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.770
Lets imagine that we were
outside on a moonlit night.

76
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.700
Clouds intermittently block
our view of the moon.

77
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:45.125
But as they do so the umbra of
the movement is alternately light or dark.

78
00:05:45.125 --> 00:05:50.960
Let me see if I can play this now on
an electronic keyboard over here.

79
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.151
[MUSIC]

80
00:05:55.151 --> 00:05:55.856
Minor.

81
00:05:55.856 --> 00:05:59.552
[MUSIC]

82
00:05:59.552 --> 00:06:00.495
Major.

83

[MUSIC]

84
00:06:03.985 --> 00:06:04.897

[MUSIC]

86
00:06:10.179 --> 00:06:12.795
And so on it goes.

87
00:06:12.795 --> 00:06:15.348
So that's how major minor triads work.

88
00:06:15.348 --> 00:06:20.221
By the way, this lovely movement
Is only the first movement

89
00:06:20.221 --> 00:06:25.200
of a three movement sonata,
a three part sonata.

90
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.810
We'll talk about sonata
later in our course.

91
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:34.431
But let's see how arpeggios
are used in the final movement.

92
00:06:34.431 --> 00:06:37.193
Here arpeggios race up and
down the keyboard.

93
00:06:37.193 --> 00:06:43.929
[MUSIC]

94
00:06:43.929 --> 00:06:50.820
Now I made hash of that just then but
it reminds me of a personal story.

95
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:55.250
When I was about 20, studying piano
at the Eastman School of Music,

96
00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:02.900
I realized that I could never play this
piece of to speed without breaking down.

97
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.810
And that was an aha moment for me.

98
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:09.200
I knew that at that point,
I'd better find another line of work.

99
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:15.420
That I was never gonna make a dime as
a professional concert pianist, and I did.

100
00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.420
Anyway.

101
00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:20.093
Anyway, you'll enjoy watching someone play
this a bit more correctly than I'm able

102
00:07:20.093 --> 00:07:22.130
to, and certainly able to now.

103
00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:24.210
As we turn to a YouTube clip,

104
00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:28.736
the last movement of Beethoven's
famous Moonlight Sonata.

105

[MUSIC]

106
00:07:32.624 --> 00:07:33.613
Minor.

107
00:07:33.613 --> 00:07:35.793
Major, arpeggio, racing up.

[MUSIC]

109
00:08:36.992 --> 00:08:43.150
Playing that was like an exhilarating
ride on the back of a wild stallion.

110
00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:46.322
Unfortunately for me,
most of the time I fell off.
