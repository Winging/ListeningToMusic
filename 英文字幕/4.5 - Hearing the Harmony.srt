[MUSIC]

2
00:00:09.995 --> 00:00:14.090
As mentioned, when most of us listen
to music, we listen to the top line,

3
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.870
where the melody resides.

4
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.070
That's where the clearest and
most memorable music is to be found.

5
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.220
But to hear the harmony and

6
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.700
the structure of the piece it's
best to get down with the base.

7
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.770
Chords are build upon a base pitch.

8
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.080
The base determines
the foundation of the chord and

9
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.700
the direction of the harmonic progression.

10
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.830
Some pop musicians such as
Paul McCartney and Sting, well,

11
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.560
they sing the melody at the same time
they lay down the basis of the harmony

12
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.240
by playing the electric bass,
the electric bass guitar.

13
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.680
To hear the base and

14
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.410
to begin to focus on the harmony,
let's build out three musical examples.

15
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.740
We'll start with a piece that
has only four chords in it, but

16
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:04.220
they repeat over and over so that
makes the harmony even easier to hear.

17
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.810
Any harmony or melody or
even rhythm that repeats again and

18
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.280
again is called an ostinato, from
the Italian word meaning obstinate thing.

19
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.057
The piece in question is an old
favorite of mine from the 1960s.

20
00:01:19.057 --> 00:01:22.770
It features voices,
this style called doo wop.

21
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.671
Here's what the bass sings as
you can see on the screen.

22
00:01:26.671 --> 00:01:32.870
[MUSIC]

23
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.234
And of course we can add chords to that.

24
00:01:37.234 --> 00:01:43.957
[MUSIC]

25
00:01:43.957 --> 00:01:46.902
In that fashion, notice major,

26
00:01:46.902 --> 00:01:48.365
[MUSIC]

27
00:01:48.365 --> 00:01:49.201
minor,

28
00:01:49.201 --> 00:01:50.199
[MUSIC]

29
00:01:50.199 --> 00:01:50.944
major,

[MUSIC]

31
00:01:51.907 --> 00:01:53.073
major triads.

32
00:01:53.073 --> 00:01:55.708
And then it just keeps on looping.

33
00:01:55.708 --> 00:01:57.774
[MUSIC]

34
00:01:57.774 --> 00:02:01.200
Now, let's listen to
a bit of this recording.

35
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.530
Notice that a new chord
comes on each downbeat.

36
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.910
That's one of the reasons, as we've said,
that we hear these as downbeats.

37
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.370
Chord changes often signal downbeats.

38
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.869
So why don't you sing along as we enjoy
Gene Chandler and the Duke of Earl?

39
00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:29.869
[MUSIC]

40
00:03:15.837 --> 00:03:16.350
Great fun.

41
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.009
All right, so you're now fully qualified
to join an a cappella doo-wop group

42
00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:24.410
because you can sing the baseline and
track the harmony.

43
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.920
But let's move on to a more complicated
example of hearing a harmony

44
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.630
from the realm of classical music.

45
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.815
Likely, you've heard of this piece also.

46
00:03:34.815 --> 00:03:39.270
It's the Canon of Johann Pachelbel,
Pachelbel's Canon.

47
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.490
The term canon in music is
simply a fancy word for round.

48
00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.210
A piece in which one voice starts out and
then the others duplicate it exactly,

49
00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.859
as in the well-known Three Blind Mice or
Row, Row, Row Your Boat.

50
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.530
With Pachelbel's Canon,
we have a double delight,

51
00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.640
because although there is a canon,
or round, in the upper three parts,

52
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.540
the canon is supported by
an ostinato bass underneath.

53
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.070
A harmony that repeats again and again.

54
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.260
Let's talk first about the bass.

55
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.640
Here it is on your screen
at one pitch level.

56
00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.293
But I'll play it actually at a pitch
level that Pachelbel wrote it.

57
00:04:19.293 --> 00:04:29.219
[MUSIC]

58
00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:35.590
Okay, eight chord ostinato bass that
repeats over and over and over.

59
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.480
So let's now focus on the upper
three parts of the score.

60
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.324
Again, as produced courtesy of our
California friend Steve Malinowski.

61
00:04:47.324 --> 00:04:52.167
You don't have to read or understand
the specifics of musical notation to

62
00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:54.970
get a sense of what's going on here.

63
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.070
Pretty simple.

64
00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.776
One voice, the leader, starts out,
and then the other voice follows along

65
00:05:00.776 --> 00:05:04.960
immediately thereafter,
at the time interval of one measure,

66
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.110
playing exactly the same thing in terms
of rhythm and pitches as the leader.

67
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.610
And then the third voice comes in and
does the same.

68
00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.210
That's what creates the canon or
the round.

69
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.940
The irony is that in the Pachelbel Canon
you don't hear the canon, or

70
00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.490
at least it's not as
obvious as one would think,

71
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.130
because all three of the upper parts
are played by the same instrument.

72
00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.030
They're assigned to the violin, so they
have the same musical timbre or sound.

73
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.760
They're in the same range.

74
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.110
They're sort of right
on top of each other.

75
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.665
So there's no separation
of the individual parts,

76
00:05:38.665 --> 00:05:44.310
which makes it difficult for
the listener to actually hear the canon.

77
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:50.313
But if we look at the music as we listen,
we can see the unfolding of the canon.

78
00:05:50.313 --> 00:05:52.071
Let's watch.

00:06:40.763 --> 00:06:43.513
reader goes on to play eighth notes.

97
00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:13.698
Hey, heads up because the leader's
going to begin with 16th notes.

98
00:07:13.698 --> 00:07:16.935
[MUSIC]

99
00:07:16.935 --> 00:07:21.799
Gives the impression that they're all
[INAUDIBLE] but the music is gathering

100
00:07:21.799 --> 00:07:26.815
momentum, even though the tempo is
completely stable, completely steady.

101
00:07:26.815 --> 00:07:30.987
As you can see by the pulse
of the notes above.

102
00:07:30.987 --> 00:07:35.620
Finally, the most sophisticated
example yet, of harmony,

103
00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:38.928
a piece by JS Bach,
a prelude for keyboard.

104
00:07:38.928 --> 00:07:42.109
Here, ironically, there's no melody.

105
00:07:42.109 --> 00:07:43.850
There's just a harmony.

106
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:53.740
[MUSIC]

107
00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.398
But what he's done is taken
those chords of the harmony and

108
00:07:57.398 --> 00:07:59.347
spread them out as arpeggios.

109
00:07:59.347 --> 00:08:09.347
[MUSIC]

110
00:08:17.423 --> 00:08:20.650
This independent harmony does not repeat.

111
00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:25.310
It's not an ostinato bass harmony,
as in our previous two examples.

112
00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:27.130
It unfolds continually.

113
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:31.180
This is one long chord
progression in the tonality of C.

114
00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:35.310
And I might add that
the original version of this,

115
00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:40.460
arguably one of Bach's most famous
pieces and in Bach's hand, for

116
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:46.130
the most part is actually in our
own Yale University library.

117
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:51.400
Bach was trying to teach his first child,
Wilhelm Friedeman Bach, how to play and

118
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.730
how to compose and

119
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:56.890
here's the way it originally looked as
you see on the left side of the screen.

120
00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:01.590
The hand on the upper left,
that's the hand of the son,

121
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:05.391
Wilhelm Friedemann, and
Bach came along and

122
00:09:05.391 --> 00:09:10.292
tried to move things along by
just prescribing chords that

123
00:09:10.292 --> 00:09:14.910
should be played toward
the bottom right of the score.

124
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:19.910
With the implication that they were
to then be executed as arpeggios.

125
00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:25.400
So, again,
this is Bach's harmony without any melody.

126
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:31.770
But, more than 100 years later
a French composer, Charles Gounod,

127
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:35.240
came along and
added a melody to Bach's harmony,

128
00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:40.080
the two together being even more rich and
pleasing than Bach's original harmony.

129
00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:43.310
A text was added to it, Ave Maria,

130
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:47.310
turning it into a religious work,
the Bach Gounod Ave Maria.

131
00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:51.490
And Bach's piece,
originally just a harmony,

132
00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:54.850
is sung today at weddings and
funerals around the world.

133
00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:58.950
In the YouTube clip that
you're about to hear,

134
00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:02.300
Bach's harmony is being
played on the piano.

135
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:07.040
And you will see Gounod's
melody as a score.

136
00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.160
I will play the melody, so

137
00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:13.850
we've got YouTube playing the harmony and
I'm playing the melody.

138
00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:17.200
YouTube is playing Bach,
I am playing Gounod.

139
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.292
Let's see if we can pull this off.

140

141
00:11:11.851 --> 00:11:12.869

[LAUGH] Almost a shame to stop,
but we've got to.

143
00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:21.669
So, there we were,
we were hearing the best of both worlds.

144
00:11:21.669 --> 00:11:27.251
Bach's original harmony
supporting Gounod's later melody.

145
00:11:27.251 --> 00:11:28.645
Pretty amazing.
