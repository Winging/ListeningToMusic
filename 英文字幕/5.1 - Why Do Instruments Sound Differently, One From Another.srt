00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:29.864 --> 00:00:32.870
Notice today I'm not playing the piano but
the violin.

3
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.290
Haha, actually just kidding.

4
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.320
I don't really play the violin.

5
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.910
This is my daughter's violin.

6
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.940
But I did go to a lot of violin lessons
during the 12 years that she studied it.

7
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.310
I am holding the violin because this
session is devoted to tone color.

8
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.850
Primarily, the colors or

9
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.980
sounds of the instruments of
the Western symphony orchestra.

10
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.640
The music we will be listening to and
indeed music that we just heard,

11
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.620
was by Rossini, his William Tell Overture.

12
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.130
There are trumpet and
french horns, and then violins.

13
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.198
Ever wonder why one instrument
sounds differently than another?

14
00:01:09.198 --> 00:01:11.580
Okay sure,
they're made from different materials and

15
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.760
have different shapes, and
that really is the answer.

16
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.920
But the sound coming out of these
instruments is actually different.

17
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.690
It has to do with the acoustics of music,
and

18
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.880
that's what I'd like to explore for
a moment.

19
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.660
Let's go back to a topic that we broached
in our first session, the overtone series.

20
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.180
Remember, when a column of air is
vibrating within the chamber of

21
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.130
a musical instrument, inside a flute or
trumpet, or a string is vibrating,

22
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.790
as on a violin,
many subparts of that column or

23
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.830
that string are also vibrating,
as we see in this diagram.

24
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.440
This shows the whole
string vibrating in red,

25
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.000
halves of the string vibrating in blue,
and thirds of it vibrating in green.

26
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.630
Now let's look at these same subsections
in a different way, standing them upright.

27
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.420
The lowest pitch is on the left,
that we call the fundamental.

28
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.220
That's the one that we actually hear,
it's basic sound.

29
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.780
And the successively smaller sections
of the string are to the right.

30
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.050
They're the overtones.

31
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.690
We hear them, but only very,
very faintly, almost subconsciously.

32
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.110
Okay.
Freeze that idea.

33
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.980
Because we're going to go, work in
another concept, and that is volume.

34
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.670
All musical sounds have a pitch.

35
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:42.550
Also, sounds have a tone color,
or timbre as it's called.

36
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.720
And they also have a volume, or loudness.

37
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.920
Let's think of pitch as sound waves
operating horizontally, you have big sound

38
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.280
waves, which create low pitches, and you
have small ones that create high pitches.

39
00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.790
But let's focus on volume for
just a moment.

40
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.390
We have these loud sounds and
we have soft sounds.

41
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.000
These are usually displayed vertically.

42
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.480
Loud ones go way up or down.

43
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.020
Soft ones up or down just a little bit.

44
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.770
To see this, let's return to our
Beethoven's Symphony Number Five, and

45
00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.490
to the active listening guide that
accompanies it at the website that you

46
00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.650
may choose to accompany this course.

47
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.490
Here, we see a scale of amplitude,
as it's called.

48
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.930
Amplitude is simply the measure
of loudness, louds spike.

49
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.388
With soft sound,
the needle doesn't move very much.

50
00:03:40.388 --> 00:03:50.388
[MUSIC]

51
00:03:52.233 --> 00:03:56.937
So watch the amplitude bars begin
growing here, begin to expand.

52
00:03:56.937 --> 00:03:58.173
[MUSIC]

53
00:03:58.173 --> 00:04:00.174
Then control.

54
00:04:00.174 --> 00:04:02.743
Expand with the loud sections.

55
00:04:02.743 --> 00:04:04.912
Contract.

56
00:04:04.912 --> 00:04:09.100
Low volume, but it's beginning to grow.

57
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.840
And you can hear this crescendo.

58
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.957
And you can indeed see this crescendo,
because the amplitude bars increase.

59
00:04:16.957 --> 00:04:19.193
[MUSIC]

60
00:04:19.193 --> 00:04:25.190
Driving the final point of loudness and
sudden disappearance of sound.

61
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.450
Okay, now let's combine these two ideas,
pitch and volume.

62
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.520
But before we did do that,
I need to say one more thing.

63
00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.870
All musical instruments generate
the same overtone series.

64
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.020
All overtones are halves of
the fundamental thirds of

65
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.580
the fundamental fourths of
the fundamental on down the line.

66
00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.580
Again, we hear them only faintly,
but each instrument, the trumpet,

67
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.490
the violin, the oboe, whatever,
generates a different amplitude for

68
00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.590
each of the overtones within the series.

69
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.790
The instruments have different patterns
of amplitude and these different

70
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.170
patterns determine the difference
in tone color of the instruments.

71
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.850
On the screen you see
the diagram of a violin.

72
00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.060
Shows the overtones for the violin.

73
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:22.410
Now, the vertical bars not only reflect
the overtones moving left to right,

74
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:28.470
but also the loudness, the amplitude for
the instrument of each overtone.

75
00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:34.610
Notice as we proceed down through the
overtones it's not a straight line decent.

76
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.750
Some of the overtones pop up quite loudly,
and others are very quiet.

77
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.140
And it's this mixing of loud overtones and

78
00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.540
soft overtones, yet all these are very,
very quiet, mind you.

79
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.710
It's this mixing that creates
a particular tone color or

80
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.840
timbre for the instrument,
just like at Starbucks.

81
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.280
The coffee meister will mix a different
blend of coffees from different regions of

82
00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.090
the world to form a holiday blend or
a bold, or whatever it might be.

83
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.830
So to here,
we have different amplitudes of

84
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:11.105
the different overtones creating
a distinctive tone color, or timbre.

85
00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.980
Lets compare the overtone chart
of a violin to that of a trumpet.

86
00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.490
You can see that's different,

87
00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.100
again here, violin is on top,
trumpet is on the bottom.

88
00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:31.830
Now watch a demonstration of how overtones
work on a trumpet as they are added in.

89
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.410
My friend Ed Doering at the Rose Hulman
Institute of Technology in Terre Haute,

90
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.230
Indiana created this and
has allowed us to make use of it.

91
00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:45.050
Remember, in the discussion here,
frequency here refers to pitch,

92
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:50.860
amplitude to volume, and here, he uses
the word partial to refer to overtone.

93
00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:55.300
Musicians and scientists use the terms
partial, a part of a string or part of

94
00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:01.500
a column of air vibrating, and overtone,
partial and overtone, interchangeably.

95
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:06.590
On this demonstration, zero is
the fundamental, that's the sound we hear.

96
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:10.370
One the first overtone,
two the second and so on.

97
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.370
Watch as this scientist
creates the sound of

98
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:18.172
a trumpet in the lab by building
up the overtone series.

99
00:07:18.172 --> 00:07:21.910
>> Here's an illustration of this
technique applied to a short burst on

100
00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:23.120
a trumpet.

101
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:28.980
I'm indicating the frequency and
amplitude trajectories, and then I can

102
00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:35.482
by using the slider, add or
subtract partials to build up the sound.

103
00:07:35.482 --> 00:07:37.340
>> First [INAUDIBLE]?
>> This is only with the first partial.

104
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:42.690
And then we can see
the corresponding amplitude of our

105
00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:44.600
sine domain signal quite nicely.

106
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.571
Here we see that the frequency
has a little bit of a, a jump at

107
00:07:48.571 --> 00:07:54.141
the beginning transient, but it's mostly
[SOUND] the same frequency throughout.

108
00:07:54.141 --> 00:07:57.865
So now I'm adding the next
partials at a higher frequency.

109
00:07:57.865 --> 00:08:01.184
[SOUND].

110
00:08:01.184 --> 00:08:06.576
This is the next one yet, even higher
frequency and as you look at the amplitude

111
00:08:06.576 --> 00:08:12.255
you notice that the onset of the higher
frequency partial is a little bit delayed.

112
00:08:12.255 --> 00:08:14.295
[SOUND].

113
00:08:14.295 --> 00:08:16.650
>> Now is he adding in all the overtones?

114
00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:22.590
>> So again you see each of these higher
frequency partials has a little bit of

115
00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:27.120
a late entrance but
then they also decay faster as well.

116
00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:29.410
>> Pretty cool.

117
00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:31.800
The more the engineer adds in overtones,

118
00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:36.370
the more we come to realize the instrument
in question is, in fact, a trumpet.

119
00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:40.660
If he put them in using other proportions
of loudness, he could make this sound

120
00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:45.590
like a clarinet or an oboe, and that's
what an electronic synthesizer does.

121
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:47.790
And that's what we have here.

122
00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:50.760
On a synthesizer you can push a button and

123
00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:56.150
program a particular amplitude series
to set up the sound of the strings,

124
00:08:56.150 --> 00:09:01.210
for example, and then hit a key and
you get the sound of the instrument that

125
00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:04.880
you've chosen, whatever instrument
you want to have produced.

126
00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.030
You have in effect the entire
orchestra at your disposal.

127
00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:09.583
Now let's see what I've got
over here at the moment.

128
00:09:09.583 --> 00:09:10.418
[MUSIC]

129
00:09:10.418 --> 00:09:15.623
Okay, that's programmed with the overtone
series of a modern grand piano.

130
00:09:15.623 --> 00:09:20.628
Let's see if I push this button
over ,here what do I get?

131
00:09:20.628 --> 00:09:21.362
Who knows?

132
00:09:21.362 --> 00:09:23.064
[MUSIC]

133
00:09:23.064 --> 00:09:24.932
Some kind of electronic organ.

134
00:09:24.932 --> 00:09:26.033
Let's try this one.

135
00:09:26.033 --> 00:09:28.035
[MUSIC]

136
00:09:28.035 --> 00:09:35.410
That's a string sound.

137
00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:38.279
String orchestra.

138
00:09:38.279 --> 00:09:43.881
To sum up, in music it's the amplitude or
loudness of the various overtones

139
00:09:43.881 --> 00:09:49.222
created by an instrument that produces
a particular blend of sound, and

140
00:09:49.222 --> 00:09:54.920
thus the distinctive tone color or
the timbre of that instrument.

141
00:09:54.920 --> 00:10:00.335
Miraculously our brain processes all
of this complicated information about

142
00:10:00.335 --> 00:10:04.581
overtones and amplitudes and
tells us in a split second hey,

143
00:10:04.581 --> 00:10:09.677
that's the sounds of a trumpet, or
hey, that's the sound of a violin.
