00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.720
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.174
Whoo, in segment one we had
a lot of technical information,

3
00:00:11.174 --> 00:00:13.210
almost like a science class.

4
00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.800
And that's about as close to a science
class as we're going to come

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.260
in our course.

6
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.120
In fact, I need a break.

7
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.960
So let's listen to some music,

8
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.000
some music that exemplifies some of
the points that we have just made.

9
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.380
Let's turn to a piece by
the Russian composer,

10
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.700
the 19th century Russian composer,
Modest Mussorgsky.

11
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.500
It's called pictures at an exhibition.

12
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.510
He originally wrote it for piano alone.

13
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.920
But later another composer,

14
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.940
the Frenchman Maurice Revel came along and
arranged it for full orchestra.

15
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.620
Here Mussorgsky tries to give us,
the listener, a feeling of walking

16
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.260
through an art gallery and stopping
at various pictures along the way.

17
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.818
Well how do you do this?

18
00:00:53.818 --> 00:00:57.960
How do you use music to
create a visual scene?

19
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.620
And how might you use
music to suggest motion,

20
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.885
that an object might actually move
before you, almost run over you?

21
00:01:04.885 --> 00:01:11.480
Mussorgsky does just that in a piece
entitled Bydlo, or Polish Ox Cart.

22
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.870
The point here is to show how volume,
tone color, and

23
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.520
the pitch of the instruments,
whether they be high or

24
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.230
low instruments, can make an object
seem to move before our eyes.

25
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.587
Remember that low sounds are created
by long sound waves, and

26
00:01:26.587 --> 00:01:30.710
that these long sound waves
are more indestructible.

27
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.790
They last longer, they go farther.

28
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.900
High sounds comes from short sound waves,
and

29
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.000
they are more easily absorbed
by the molecules of the air.

30
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.660
Let's start here at the keyboard.

31
00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.810
You'll hear a bass repeating,
suggesting the rocking of the cart or

32
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.550
the wagon, and
then a solo instrument will come in.

33
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.452
Okay, so here's the bass beginning.

34
00:01:54.452 --> 00:01:59.293
[MUSIC]

35
00:01:59.293 --> 00:02:00.521
And so on.

36
00:02:00.521 --> 00:02:04.197
Now let's turn to
the audio on the clip here.

37
00:02:04.197 --> 00:02:09.830
[MUSIC]

38
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.804
So what is the solo instrument?

39
00:02:12.804 --> 00:02:22.033
[MUSIC]

40
00:02:22.033 --> 00:02:26.640
Well as you can see on the screen,
it's a tuba.

41
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.628
But it's a small one that sounds

42
00:02:31.628 --> 00:02:35.889
high in the tuba register.

43
00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:38.311
You may not recognize it as being a tuba,
but

44
00:02:38.311 --> 00:02:40.485
it is a tuba playing in a high register.

45
00:02:40.485 --> 00:02:50.485
[MUSIC]

46
00:02:59.434 --> 00:03:01.711
We're gonna hear now the strings come in.

47
00:03:01.711 --> 00:03:06.161
And if the tuba melody generally
went up and then down,

48
00:03:06.161 --> 00:03:10.723
the string melody has mostly
a descending trajectory.

49
00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:21.137
[MUSIC]

50
00:03:21.137 --> 00:03:24.448
Okay, so
now let's continue with a string melody,

51
00:03:24.448 --> 00:03:27.240
and we'll hear a little
bit of a crescendo.

52
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.382
Okay, here are the strings coming in.

53
00:03:31.382 --> 00:03:41.382
[MUSIC]

54
00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.497
Okay, gradually getting louder.

55
00:03:53.497 --> 00:04:03.497
[MUSIC]

56
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.333
Gradual crescendo, okay,

57
00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:14.994
now here we're going to pause it again.

58
00:04:14.994 --> 00:04:17.825
In a moment let's hear
the full strings play.

59
00:04:17.825 --> 00:04:20.010
But now they are going
to play the tuba melody.

60
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.811
They are going to play the tuba melody,
and

61
00:04:21.811 --> 00:04:24.476
they are going to play it
altogether in what's called unison.

62
00:04:24.476 --> 00:04:26.573
They are playing all the pitches together.

63
00:04:26.573 --> 00:04:36.573
[MUSIC]

64
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:38.578
And so on.

65
00:04:38.578 --> 00:04:44.567
And it's played at the loudest,
the highest of volume intensity.

66
00:04:44.567 --> 00:04:46.471
So let's just recommence
where we left off.

67
00:04:46.471 --> 00:04:56.471
[MUSIC]

68
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.149
Snare drum has been added.

69
00:05:01.149 --> 00:05:03.396
[MUSIC]

70
00:05:03.396 --> 00:05:05.344
You can hear the bass drum underneath.

71
00:05:05.344 --> 00:05:14.841
[MUSIC]

72
00:05:14.841 --> 00:05:16.149
Begins to get quieter.

73
00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:22.616
[MUSIC]

74
00:05:22.616 --> 00:05:23.352
The cart has passed us.

75
00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.284
Tuba melody comes back in,
but it's getting fainter.

76
00:05:29.284 --> 00:05:39.284
[MUSIC]

77
00:05:42.495 --> 00:05:44.264
Melody's disappeared.

78
00:05:44.264 --> 00:05:45.665
It's been fragmented.

79
00:05:45.665 --> 00:05:49.380
[MUSIC]

80
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.929
There's a fragment.

81
00:05:50.929 --> 00:05:56.570
All we're left with, low thumping
with the low instruments in the bass.

82
00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:06.077
[MUSIC]

83
00:06:06.077 --> 00:06:07.950
Very interesting.

84
00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:11.620
I hope you'll agree that Mussorgsky
has created a motion picture here

85
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.010
through music.

86
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:14.940
But how did he do that?

87
00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.452
Well, let's see how some students in
the classroom thought Mussorgsky did that,

88
00:06:19.452 --> 00:06:21.459
made the ox cart move through sound.

89
00:06:21.459 --> 00:06:22.943
Again, how did he do that?

90
00:06:22.943 --> 00:06:24.388
That young lady out here, please.

91
00:06:24.388 --> 00:06:27.705
>> Crescendo.
>> Okay, crescendo, from beginning to end?

92
00:06:27.705 --> 00:06:29.734
>> Beginning to middle and end.

93
00:06:29.734 --> 00:06:36.150
>> Yeah so like a giant wedge, so that's
why the cart seems to be in front of you.

94
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.526
So we are talking about
musical volume here.

95
00:06:38.526 --> 00:06:40.058
It started very quietly.

96
00:06:40.058 --> 00:06:44.971
It built up to this huge center, in which
we had the bass drum pounding away there,

97
00:06:44.971 --> 00:06:49.674
and the snare drum coming in to give the
effect that the entire earth is rattling

98
00:06:49.674 --> 00:06:52.010
at that particular point.

99
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:56.561
And then, as it passed by you,
the thunder passed by you and

100
00:06:56.561 --> 00:07:01.216
off you went into the distance,
quietly into the distance.

101
00:07:01.216 --> 00:07:03.170
And we'll come back to that.

102
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:05.863
But how did that happen?

103
00:07:05.863 --> 00:07:08.170
We'll listen to the end of
that in just one moment.

104
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:14.860
It's kind of a disintegration
of the sound at the end.

105
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:19.300
So that's one big way this happens.

106
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.527
That's probably the big ticket item here.

107
00:07:21.527 --> 00:07:24.220
There's another way, a more subtle way.

108
00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.560
So there's a kind of wedge shape
with regards to the instruments too.

109
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.056
He starts with the lowest instruments, and

110
00:07:31.056 --> 00:07:37.206
then goes to the high instruments and
then back to low instruments at the end.

111
00:07:37.206 --> 00:07:43.880
But what I was thinking about here is
this idea that the lowest sounds create,

112
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:48.714
or the longest sound waves,
and they last the longest.

113
00:07:48.714 --> 00:07:53.320
The lowest sounds create the largest
sound waves, and they last the longest.

114
00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.270
The lowest sounds last the longest.

115
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:57.625
Why might this be the case?

116
00:07:57.625 --> 00:08:03.335
We're not having too much confidence
in our slides this morning.

117
00:08:03.335 --> 00:08:06.230
I went ahead up and
put this one up on the board here.

118
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:07.220
Here is one pitch.

119
00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:10.550
Here is a pitch of
a string an octave higher.

120
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:11.930
So you can see it this way.

121
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:15.760
As you probably know,
if you take a long string and pluck it,

122
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:20.740
it's gonna take that long string a long
time to pass that sort of cycle,

123
00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:23.240
if you will,
just one pass through that cycle.

124
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:27.192
The string half a length will pass
through that cycle two times.

125
00:08:27.192 --> 00:08:33.313
So that you can kind of graph these
up here as one long low sound,

126
00:08:33.313 --> 00:08:38.370
or one faster vibrating
sound an octave higher.

127
00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:44.800
So again, low sounds, or
low frequencies travel farther.

128
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.050
Now you've experienced
this in your own life.

129
00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.210
You're standing on a street
corner here in New Haven.

130
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:51.160
In the distance, what do you here?

131
00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:55.370
An automobile approaching with
a souped up audio system in it.

132
00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:58.805
And what sound do you
hear at the very first?

133
00:08:58.805 --> 00:09:03.684
[SOUND] That kind of thing.

134
00:09:03.684 --> 00:09:08.287
Then maybe [SOUND].

135
00:09:08.287 --> 00:09:10.930
And then maybe some kind
of melody will come in.

136
00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:12.920
And then it'll all come together
right in front of you, and

137
00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.090
it'll kind of disappear in the distance.

138
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:16.114
You're at a football game.

139
00:09:16.114 --> 00:09:18.070
You've probably experienced this too.

140
00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:19.923
The band is marching on the field.

141
00:09:19.923 --> 00:09:25.570
Suddenly they do the Doppler effect where
they turn their backs to you in a way.

142
00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:29.370
And they're playing away from you,
and you hear very little sound.

143
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.240
What instrumental sound do you hear?

144
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.558
Boom, boom, boom,
the bass drum and the tuba.

145
00:09:36.558 --> 00:09:39.472
Or in the marching band it would be
a sousaphone they would call it,

146
00:09:39.472 --> 00:09:40.945
the bass drum and tuba.

147
00:09:40.945 --> 00:09:44.785
So Mussorgsky knew this kind of thing
because he was a professional musician and

148
00:09:44.785 --> 00:09:48.495
was playing off of it to
create this rather unusual and

149
00:09:48.495 --> 00:09:52.265
remarkable musical soundscape here.

150
00:09:52.265 --> 00:09:55.014
Okay, let's see if you
were paying attention, and

151
00:09:55.014 --> 00:09:57.711
that guy in the classroom
didn't put you to sleep.

152
00:09:57.711 --> 00:09:59.343
Let's do a recap quiz.
