[MUSIC]

2
00:00:09.201 --> 00:00:13.079
Western classical orchestra is made
up of four primary families or

3
00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:14.542
groups of instruments.

4
00:00:14.542 --> 00:00:17.595
The strings, woodwinds,
brasses, and percussions.

5
00:00:17.595 --> 00:00:18.095
Let's start with the string family.

6
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.970
In it we have the violin,
the slightly larger viola,

7
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.990
which sounds lower than the violin,
the cello and the double bass.

8
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.740
The double bass is called the because
early on in the 17th and 18th centuries,

9
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.260
that's essential what it did,

10
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.470
it doubled the bass line down an octave
below what the cellos were playing.

11
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.810
Strictly speaking,

12
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.960
the double bass is the descendant of the
old Viol family of stringed instruments.

13
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.210
Which had a slightly different
tuning of the instrument.

14
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.900
And we'll come back to the Viol
family when we get to the music of

15
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.190
the Renaissance.

16
00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.240
But the double bass is still
very much a stringed instrument.

17
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.560
The cello is in baritone range
of the strings, in the mid base.

18
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.800
It can play high or low.

19
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.170
It's my favorite stringed instrument.

20
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.460
When I die, and get reborn, reincarnated,
I'm coming back as a cello.

21
00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.070
No, just kidding of course,
but I do like that sound.

22
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.690
The sound of a well played cello

23
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.840
In its mid to upper range
is indescribably beautiful.

24
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.960
Well here in a moment a clip
of Yo-Yo Ma playing the cello.

25
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.870
And here's a photograph of him that I took
at a concert in New Haven some years ago.

26
00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.930
Later I met him at the Tanglewood
Music Festival in the summer.

27
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.738
He's very smart and very funny.

28
00:01:38.738 --> 00:01:45.420
Anyway, here's Yo-Yo Ma playing a bit of
the Saint-SaÃ«ns Carnival of the Animals.

29
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.806
The video part here isn't very good but
it's been viewed by more than two million

30
00:01:49.806 --> 00:01:53.630
people on YouTube so the sound,
at least, must be awfully darn good.

31
00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:03.630
[MUSIC]

32
00:02:36.398 --> 00:02:41.960
Notice that as Mister Ma was playing,
his left hand was shaking constantly.

33
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:42.835
Was he nervous?

34
00:02:42.835 --> 00:02:46.970
[LAUGH] No, with that kind of talent,
there's no reason to be nervous.

35
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.860
He was of course,
using a playing technique called vibrato.

36
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.150
It makes the pitch oscillate ever so
slightly actually,

37
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.500
a pure anything in music
is not as exciting

38
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.440
as something that is slightly off and
slightly on, off an on, and off and on.

39
00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.610
It yields a richer emotional experience.

40
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.160
Let's listen now to a second
video clip of the same piece.

41
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.597
Notice here how Yo Yo Ma ever so
slightly slides into the pitch,

42
00:03:17.597 --> 00:03:22.420
again giving us the sense of
a little emotional tug, and

43
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.876
how the tempo slows down and
then speeds back up here and there.

44
00:03:27.876 --> 00:03:32.480
And again, notice how these slight
imperfections, quote, unquote,

45
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.377
create expression in music.

46
00:03:34.377 --> 00:03:39.996
This is how a great performer
communicates emotion to us.

47
00:03:39.996 --> 00:03:49.996
[MUSIC]

48
00:04:23.494 --> 00:04:25.050
Gosh so beautiful.

49
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.020
Would if we could all do that.

50
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.828
Well we've heard a cello playing
a beautiful melody with bravado,

51
00:04:32.828 --> 00:04:37.719
now we turn to another class
demonstration, using not a violin, but

52
00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:41.791
the slightly larger and
slightly lower sounding viola.

53
00:04:41.791 --> 00:04:46.338
Here we learn about other string
techniques in addition to vibrato namely

54
00:04:46.338 --> 00:04:47.888
pizzicato and tremolo.

55
00:04:47.888 --> 00:04:54.481
[MUSIC]

56
00:04:54.481 --> 00:04:56.091
>> Well,
you did something there at the end,

57
00:04:56.091 --> 00:04:57.720
did you have too much coffee this morning?

58
00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.580
You started shaking
>> Probably, my hands.

59
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.660
>> So tell us about what you
were doing there at the end.

60
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.792
>> So there are all sorts of
different little technique things

61
00:05:04.792 --> 00:05:06.922
you can do to create different colors and

62
00:05:06.922 --> 00:05:10.319
sounds on all string instruments so
this applies to any of them.

63
00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:13.832
One of them is the technique you saw me
do with my left hand where I wiggled it

64
00:05:13.832 --> 00:05:15.658
a little bit, it's called vibrato.

65
00:05:15.658 --> 00:05:19.036
You hear it in human voice as well and you
can do it on other instruments as well.

66
00:05:19.036 --> 00:05:21.173
But on the string instrument
it is the difference.

67
00:05:21.173 --> 00:05:24.062
I'll play a melody without vibrato and
then with vibrato so

68
00:05:24.062 --> 00:05:25.457
you can see the difference.

69
00:05:25.457 --> 00:05:35.457
[MUSIC]

70
00:05:37.494 --> 00:05:39.236
So that's without bravado.

71
00:05:39.236 --> 00:05:41.430
Not that interesting in my opinion.

72
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:42.578
So with bravado.

73
00:05:42.578 --> 00:05:52.578
[MUSIC]

74
00:05:55.987 --> 00:05:58.135
And you can vary the width and
the speed and the length.

75
00:05:58.135 --> 00:05:59.772
There's a lot of variety with which.

76
00:05:59.772 --> 00:06:02.071
>> Okay, and
then just quickly play a pizzicato for us.

77
00:06:02.071 --> 00:06:03.335
>> Sure.

78
00:06:03.335 --> 00:06:09.686
[MUSIC]

79
00:06:09.686 --> 00:06:12.715
>> Okay, and then finally, tremolo.

80
00:06:12.715 --> 00:06:13.691
>> Yes.

81
00:06:15.096 --> 00:06:18.393
[MUSIC]

82
00:06:18.393 --> 00:06:21.527
>> Adds a little excitement or
a little filler to the music sometimes.

83
00:06:29.352 --> 00:06:32.800
>> All right, so
let's move on now to the woodwind family.

84
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.390
Here's a picture that gives you
a sense of the relative size of the,

85
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:39.420
you can see left to right,
what do we have?

86
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:44.590
Bassoon, clarinet, saxophone, which really
isn't part of the symphony orchestra.

87
00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:45.760
But there it is anyway.

88
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.580
It most often plays in a band
of one sort or another.

89
00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.820
Then, the English horn, a lower oboe,
and then the oboe itself.

90
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.960
And then finally, the flute.

91
00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.800
You'll notice a couple of things here.

92
00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.160
The flute is made of metal, but
originally it was made of wood.

93
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.810
Also, you'll see that the flute, like
its relative, the recorder has no reed.

94
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:09.710
You actually blow in the top of
the instrument, a hole on the top.

95
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.850
The other instruments have reeds.

96
00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:15.510
So let's see some of these reeds
as we look at our next slide.

97
00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:21.230
The clarinet is a single reed instrument,

98
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:26.440
while the bassoon, English horn and
oboe are double reed instruments.

99
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.890
The nature of the reed affects
the vibration of air within the column or

100
00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:34.530
the tube of the instrument and
sets up the difference in overtones

101
00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:38.328
that we discussed previously
in today's session.

102
00:07:38.328 --> 00:07:44.800
Generally speaking, or
in point of fact, the violin and

103
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.410
the oboe and the flute, they all
play more or less in the same range.

104
00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:49.980
The flute is slightly higher,

105
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:55.370
its bottom note is middle C, about a
fourth higher than the other instruments.

106
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:59.950
Okay, so let's go on now to watch
a demonstration of a woodwind instrument.

107
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:02.330
Specifically, the bassoon.

108
00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.840
This is Linda Paul,
who will be one of our principle TAs here.

109
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.640
She is a PhD candidate in
the department of music,

110
00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.740
just passed her qualifying
exam with flying colors.

111
00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:15.603
So here she is to demonstrate
the bassoon for us,

112
00:08:15.603 --> 00:08:18.721
lowest member of the woodwind family.

113
00:08:18.721 --> 00:08:22.320
>> All right, so you probably read in
the book that the bassoon is a double

114
00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.443
reed instrument and so
just to show you what that looks like.

115
00:08:25.443 --> 00:08:27.957
You've probably seen it but
if you haven't,

116
00:08:27.957 --> 00:08:31.189
two pieces of wood vibrate
together when I blow threw them.

117
00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:36.742
[SOUND] Always check it out
before I play any notes and

118
00:08:36.742 --> 00:08:41.263
as you will probably suspect by the length

119
00:08:41.263 --> 00:08:46.061
of the bassoon,
it can play very low notes.

120
00:08:46.061 --> 00:08:50.704
[MUSIC]

121
00:08:50.704 --> 00:08:53.560
And if I put a little rag in the top
I can get it even a little bit lower.

122
00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.670
And that, I didn't bring one.

123
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:59.630
But actually, amazingly,
it's a very versatile instrument.

124
00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:04.242
It can also play very high notes, as you
can see, there are a lot of keys on it.

125
00:09:04.242 --> 00:09:07.586
There are nine keys for
my left thumb alone.

126
00:09:07.586 --> 00:09:11.414
So I'm switching between these on
the back here and many others, and

127
00:09:11.414 --> 00:09:15.050
because of that, I can go very
high I'll just demonstrate that.

128
00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:25.050
[MUSIC]

129
00:09:33.903 --> 00:09:36.443
So that's just to give
you a sense of the range,

130
00:09:36.443 --> 00:09:40.510
because of the sort of particular
character of the bassoon's sound, it's

131
00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:44.659
often used to play sort of funny little
low note characters in the orchestra.

132
00:09:44.659 --> 00:09:49.380
For example, if you're familiar with Peter
and the Wolf, different instruments play

133
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:52.530
different characters,
the bassoon is the grandfather.

134
00:09:52.530 --> 00:10:02.530
[MUSIC]

135
00:10:15.655 --> 00:10:19.140
>> You heard some of the strings and
some of the woodwinds.

136
00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:22.710
Now we're gonna turn to the brass
instruments, and here again we have

137
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:27.560
instruments of various sizes,
various members of the brass family.

138
00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.090
On this particular side we
can see from top to bottom.

139
00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:35.160
Trumpet over there in the top left, french
horn in the middle, and trombone below.

140
00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:39.410
And then two tubas to the right,
one large and one small.

141
00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.790
The principle involved with
the brass instrument is simple.

142
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:49.300
Each has in one way or another a tube or
pipe that ultimately connects to a bell.

143
00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.570
And that helps to disperse the sound.

144
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:57.360
To prove the point, I and
my trusty media coordinator

145
00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:01.600
Guy Ontivella constructed
a brass instrument.

146
00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.300
Well, sort of.

147
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:09.470
We took a mouthpiece, this is actually the
mouthpiece from his daughter's trombone,

148
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:15.620
and a funnel that I use in my
garage to funnel gasoline.

149
00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:19.750
And we connected them through a tube
that we will pretend is made of metal.

150
00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:21.670
Specifically of brass.

151
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:27.010
One a french horn, this tube of metal or
brass could be as long as 12 feet.

152
00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:31.680
So you're about to hear and I'll have
to stand up for this world premier.

153
00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:36.147
You're about to hear
Strauss' Also Sprach Zarathustra

154
00:11:36.147 --> 00:11:40.436
played on a brand new instrument,
the trombone funnel

155
00:11:46.553 --> 00:11:52.380
[SOUND] Oddly enough,
it was playing the first

156
00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:57.747
overtone, [LAUGH] the second overtone and

157
00:11:57.747 --> 00:12:03.898
the third overtone, and
we could fill in with.

158
00:12:03.898 --> 00:12:12.197
[MUSIC]

159
00:12:12.197 --> 00:12:17.850
Obviously, Yale University is at the
cutting edge of science and technology.

160
00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:23.120
[LAUGH] And equally obvious,
as we look at this slide

161
00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:28.380
once again, the longer the piece of pipe,
the lower the sound.

162
00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:32.500
The player pulls in or out a slide,
makes the tubing longer or

163
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.760
shorter, raises or lowers the pitch.

164
00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:38.230
Or he opens and
closes valves on a trumpet or

165
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:43.280
a French horn, thereby making
the length of pipe longer or shorter.

166
00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.250
And the pitch is thereby adjusted.

167
00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:52.260
To each of the brass instruments
is attached a mouthpiece.

168
00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:53.430
Let's see if I can detach this.

169
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:56.520
I have no idea what's gonna happen,
yep, there it goes.

170
00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:00.230
So here's the mouthpiece for a trombone.

171
00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:06.740
And they come in various sizes according
to the instrument in question.

172
00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:11.070
Lets watch a demonstration of
a real brass instrument here,

173
00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:13.000
the french horn, from a class session.

174
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:18.100
This is my friend long time colleague
music library extraordinaire and

175
00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:22.760
professional french horn player Ava Heder,
who will demonstrate here.

176
00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.250
Come on over here right in the center.

177
00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:27.870
Jean Kimball is in the basement
somewhere recording all of this.

178
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:29.575
>> Oh my.
>> Oh yes, very exciting here.

179
00:13:29.575 --> 00:13:32.000
>> [LAUGH]
>> What a time to be alive, huh?

180
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.860
>> Yeah.
>> So, Eva's just going to demonstrate

181
00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:38.250
the physical process of
playing the french horn.

182
00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:42.750
>> The horn, obviously,
is a brass instrument, and

183
00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:45.970
what makes the sound is
a vibrating column of air.

184
00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:50.185
In this case, the basic column of air
is twelve and a half feet long and

185
00:13:50.185 --> 00:13:54.766
there's something called partials or
the harmonic series that happens in

186
00:13:54.766 --> 00:13:57.765
anything with a string instrument or
whatever.

187
00:13:57.765 --> 00:14:02.107
But, on the horn, it's very distinct and
that's what makes the different note.

188
00:14:02.107 --> 00:14:05.890
Let me demonstrate to
you the harmonic series.

189
00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:15.890
[MUSIC]

190
00:14:23.584 --> 00:14:25.400
No, I didn't use, no hands.

191
00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.890
That was just the notes that
are naturally on the 12 and

192
00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:32.810
a half foot length of a vibrating air.

193
00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:34.960
That's the harmonic series.

194
00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:40.370
That's on that And what the valves
do is they shorten and lengthen

195
00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:45.620
that vibrating column of air, very much
like a cello string on a finger board.

196
00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:50.490
You know a cellist is always
shortening and lengthening the strings.

197
00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:51.550
I'm doing the same thing.

198
00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:53.240
I'm just doing it with
a series of switches.

199
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:59.710
This instead of a fingerboard,
which we obviously don't have.

200
00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:00.420
>> Okay.
That's fun.

201
00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:00.940
That's great.

202
00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:02.001
That's the principle.

203
00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:04.965
And when she says she'd overblow it,
what that means is, and

204
00:15:04.965 --> 00:15:07.423
we'll keep emphasizing this point today,
that.

205
00:15:07.423 --> 00:15:12.491
And these partials that when I sounds
is made you have not just one sound but

206
00:15:12.491 --> 00:15:15.352
that tube is divide it
up into sections and

207
00:15:15.352 --> 00:15:19.460
all kinds of little sections
of that one tube are sounding.

208
00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:23.270
Not just the big sound but
the partials, or the overtones.

209
00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:25.671
The intervals of the harmonic series.

210
00:15:31.812 --> 00:15:33.760
Finally the percussion family.

211
00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.940
But I'm not gonna say too much about them.

212
00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:37.200
Course we have the bass drum.

213
00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:37.850
Boom.

214
00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:38.490
Boom.

215
00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:39.100
Boom.

216
00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:40.150
Boom.

217
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:41.018
And the snare drum.

218
00:15:41.018 --> 00:15:41.785
Ratta-tat.

219
00:15:41.785 --> 00:15:42.552
Ratta-tat.

220
00:15:42.552 --> 00:15:43.320
Ratta-tat.

221
00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:46.110
And the ding, the triangle.

222
00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:50.630
These instruments for
the most part don't change pitch.

223
00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:52.170
For the symphony orchestra, however,

224
00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:56.060
the principal percussion instrument
is the timpani or kettle drums,

225
00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:59.390
called kettle drums of course, because
they look like large kettles or pots.

226
00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.220
They can sound different pitches.

227
00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:04.900
They do change pitch.

228
00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:08.770
On the screen here you
see four kettle drums.

229
00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:12.150
Usually at the time of Mozart and Haydn,
in the period of classical music,

230
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:13.920
there would be only two on the stage.

231
00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:18.510
They were tuned to play the tonic and
the dominant notes.

232
00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:23.180
And to get them in tune you could push
the pedals that you see on the slide here.

233
00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:25.050
That's what the pedals are for.

234
00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:29.940
They make it possible to change the pitch.

235
00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:35.300
The skin head or
the plastic head on the drum.

236
00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:37.930
So back in the time of Haydn,
Mozart, and Beethoven you really

237
00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:41.320
only used two of these and they were
tuned to the tonic and dominant and

238
00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:46.000
they could emphasize the authentic
cadences at critical points in the music.

239
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.490
Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum.

240
00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:51.590
That's what they would play.

241
00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:57.030
But generally, what the percussions
instruments do is identity and

242
00:16:57.030 --> 00:17:00.750
intensity and articulation to the music.

243
00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:06.520
Yes, the bass drum and snare drum, they
can help keep a strong beat in the music.

244
00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:12.300
And so can the symbol, crash, crash, cash,
crash, crash, cash, crash, crash, cash.

245
00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:15.820
But the cymbal crashing music most
particularly in romantic music

246
00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:18.180
often comes at the top
of a musical line and

247
00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:21.530
the end of a long crescendo,
end of a big increase in volume.

248
00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:27.140
This is what I mean by saying that
the percussion instrument gives definition

249
00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:30.480
to the music and
helps tell us where we are.

250
00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:35.236
>> In romantic music, when you hear a long
crescendo by the full orchestra, and

251
00:17:35.236 --> 00:17:36.992
then [SOUND], cymbal crash,

252
00:17:36.992 --> 00:17:40.960
that crash is signifying to
the listener that we are at the peak.

253
00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.340
This is the top, this is the high point.

254
00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:46.720
This is the emotional
high point of the piece.

255
00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.226
When the symbol player
crashes the two together,

256
00:17:50.226 --> 00:17:53.908
he might just as well be saying,
this is the climax.
