[MUSIC]

2
00:00:06.046 --> 00:00:10.158
I'd like to turn now to a very brief
overview of the development of the western

3
00:00:10.158 --> 00:00:12.280
symphony orchestra.

4
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.540
Here's a seating plan for modern
symphony orchestra and its instruments.

5
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.390
It's just one of several
commonly used arrangements.

6
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.220
As we look at it,

7
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.490
let's think about how our modern
symphony orchestra began to take shape.

8
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.730
The nucleus was provided by
the strings during the 17th century,

9
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.610
when the violin came into prominence.

10
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.870
It and other members of the violin family,
a cousin,

11
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.300
came to form the core of the ensemble,
the string core.

12
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.460
Violins, violas, cellos,
double basses, and occasionally harps.

13
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.440
Soon, some woodwind
instruments were added.

14
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.470
Usually oboes and bassoons.

15
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.320
Often doubling, playing the same
pitches as doubling the string parts.

16
00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.200
By the end of the 17th century,

17
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.080
French horns could be added to give
greater body or substance to the sound.

18
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.880
Around 1700, should a composer want to
create a particularly splendid sound,

19
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.270
he might add trumpets and tympani.

20
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.850
Flutes and clarinets didn't join
the orchestra until the 18th century, and

21
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.990
the trombone and tuba not until the 19th.

22
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.400
Other percussive instruments,
not until the 20th century.

23
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.950
Notice that the brass and

24
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.850
the percussion here, are all the way
at the back of the orchestra.

25
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.550
That's where they almost always go.

26
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.580
Because they can be very loud.

27
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.970
That's a quick thumbnail sketch of
how the orchestra developed for

28
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.370
classical music in the west.

29
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.447
It grew from a group of about
15 in the 17th century,

30
00:01:45.447 --> 00:01:49.100
to more than a hundred by
the end of the 19th century.

31
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.700
Today the New York Philharmonic, a typical
well established orchestra has by contract

32
00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:02.022
with the musicians union, exactly 106
members, not including the conductor.

33
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.420
But what does a conductor do?

34
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.440
Obviously, he or
she is something of a musical traffic cop.

35
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.170
Leading the orchestra, setting the tempo,
assuring the proper dynamic level,

36
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.340
waving in a soloist now and then,
balancing the various sections,

37
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.250
making sure that all
the pitches are in tune.

38
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.300
All of this so

39
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.560
that the essential message of the music
is heard in a convincing fashion.

40
00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.060
Here's a picture of my friend
Toshi Shimada, whose conducted many first

41
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.360
line orchestras in the United States,
Europe, and the Far East.

42
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.690
The orchestra is a medium,
it's a medium between the creator and

43
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.950
the perceiver of a work of art,
between the composer and the listener.

44
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.280
It's the job of
the conductor to facilitate

45
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.940
the communication between these two,
between creator and receiver.

46
00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.450
Notice the arrow pointing
to the conductor's score.

47
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.610
It's kind of a musical road map.

48
00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.880
The conductor will glance at this
from time to time to remember

49
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.250
when to throw a cue to a player, or
perhaps to beat an especially clear

50
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.290
beat pattern to set an unambiguous tempo.

51
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.920
Let's zero in on what
a conductor's score looks like.

52
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.860
We could also call it the full score.

53
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.010
Conductor's score, full score, same thing.

54
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.890
Let's see what it looks like.

55
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.260
Here, the woodwinds are on top.

56
00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.310
The first four lines at the top there,

57
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.250
the woodwind parts,
running down from flute to a bassoon.

58
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.690
Then we have in the middle the brasses,
followed by the percussion.

59
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.790
And the bottom four parts
are the string parts.

60
00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:53.070
First and second violins and violas and
in this case cellos and basses together.

61
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.080
The players in the orchestra,
they have only their individual parts.

62
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.296
Just one line on their stands, but the
conductor has a composite of all of them.

63
00:04:04.296 --> 00:04:08.462
Now I choose here an image from
Beethoven's Symphony Number 3.

64
00:04:08.462 --> 00:04:11.920
Because that's what we're
about to hear next.

65
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.360
But notice in passing how many
different lines are playing at once.

66
00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.720
Does the conductor hear all of this?

67
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.950
Well a good one will.

68
00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.740
But even so, he or she is still
responsible for, still gotta concentrate

69
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.320
on the essential part of the musical
message, and that's usually the melody.

70
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.620
Having discussed the tone color of
the various orchestral instruments and

71
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.250
briefly how the orchestra
came to be formed,

72
00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.350
let's see how they can work together
to create a glorious effect.

73
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.970
We turn now to a performance part of
the end of Beethoven's Symphony Number 3,

74
00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.490
the Eroica symphony.

75
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.420
We'll talk more about the history of
this work when we get to Beethoven.

76
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.670
But for the moment,
let's just concentrate on the music.

77
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.670
Toward the end of this four movement,
and by that,

78
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.610
we simply mean four section symphony.

79
00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.640
Movement is simply an independent section.

80
00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.280
The end of this four movement symphony.

81
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.130
Toward the end of it,
we hear these sorts of sounds.

82
00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:21.296
We'll be following along here
with the conductor's score.

83
00:05:21.296 --> 00:05:31.962
[MUSIC]

84
00:05:31.962 --> 00:05:35.120
This is a good example of a half-cadence.

85
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.190
We could call it a pause cadence
because that's what it does,

86
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.730
creates a sense of delay, an expectation.

87
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:46.270
The music stops here, but we really
want it to go on, we want to hear more.

88
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.810
And what we hear then is a beautiful soft,
melodious passage played

89
00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.580
by the woodwinds and
you'll never believe what you're hearing.

90
00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.990
These are students playing,
undergraduates.

91
00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:03.172
This is the Undergraduate Yale
Symphony Orchestra, let's listen.

92
00:06:03.172 --> 00:06:13.172
[MUSIC]

93
00:06:26.837 --> 00:06:29.587
Then, across the page.

94
00:06:29.587 --> 00:06:34.005
[MUSIC]

95
00:06:36.087 --> 00:06:40.832
Then I ask the players to take this apart,
this same passage, to show the tone

96
00:06:40.832 --> 00:06:45.879
colors of the various instruments, and
how the instruments blend their sounds.

97
00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:50.295
We'll start with the oboe
as it plays the melody.

98
00:06:50.295 --> 00:07:00.295
[MUSIC]

99
00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:23.379
Next, the bassoon,
as it plays the bass line.

100
00:07:23.379 --> 00:07:33.379
[MUSIC]

101
00:07:52.296 --> 00:07:58.796
Then oboe and bassoon as they
play base and melody together.

102
00:07:58.796 --> 00:08:02.172
[MUSIC]

103
00:08:02.172 --> 00:08:06.460
Notice here, that they're often
going in opposite directions.

104
00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.380
This is called counterpoint.

105
00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:12.010
Points moving against each other or
pitches moving against each other.

106
00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:17.860
This is the kind of thing they teach you
to do in basic music composition courses.

107
00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:18.837
Make good counter points.

108
00:08:18.837 --> 00:08:27.172
[MUSIC]

109
00:08:27.172 --> 00:08:30.248
There are also two clarinets
playing in this passage.

110
00:08:30.248 --> 00:08:35.754
They help fill out the harmony
in the middle of the texture.

111
00:08:35.754 --> 00:08:38.020
[MUSIC]

112
00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.620
Notice that they generally move together.

113
00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:45.504
They're not creating the essential
counterpoint of the melody and bass.

114
00:08:45.504 --> 00:08:52.352
Internal filler would be
closer to the mark here.

115
00:08:52.352 --> 00:09:02.352
[MUSIC]

116
00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:07.450
All right.

117
00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:10.963
Now let's put this all
back together again.

118
00:09:10.963 --> 00:09:15.981
Another bassoon is added, and

119
00:09:15.981 --> 00:09:21.578
toward the end a French horn sneaks

120
00:09:21.578 --> 00:09:28.140
in to give even more weight to the sound,

121
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:33.544
let's see if we can pick it up with

122
00:09:33.544 --> 00:09:38.378
the woodwinds all together.

123
00:09:38.378 --> 00:09:42.420
[MUSIC]

124
00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:49.129
Here comes the french horn.

125
00:09:49.129 --> 00:09:51.296
[MUSIC]

126
00:09:54.629 --> 00:09:59.797
Now, at this point Beethoven extends
the music to the string section

127
00:09:59.797 --> 00:10:05.530
with solos being inserted for
clarinet and then one for the oboe.

128
00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:09.335
So, let's back up here, and
hear this entire section again.

129
00:10:09.335 --> 00:10:13.665
Strings lead up to a pause, the half
cadence that we heard then the beautiful

130
00:10:13.665 --> 00:10:18.615
soft passage for wood winds then the
strings take the lead take the music back

131
00:10:18.615 --> 00:10:24.795
again, and out of it grows the solo
first for clarinet and then for oboe.

132
00:10:24.795 --> 00:10:29.129
And again let's follow the full score
here just as the conductor would see it.

133
00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:34.867
Almost no one can read
all this music at once,

134
00:10:34.867 --> 00:10:39.548
but I thought you might enjoy a peek at

135
00:10:39.548 --> 00:10:44.087
what the conductor actually sees.

136
00:10:44.087 --> 00:10:47.337
[MUSIC]

137
00:10:47.337 --> 00:10:48.546
Cadence.

138
00:10:48.546 --> 00:10:58.546
[MUSIC]

139
00:11:27.254 --> 00:11:28.423
Clarinet solo.

140
00:11:28.423 --> 00:11:36.296
[MUSIC]

141
00:11:36.296 --> 00:11:37.254
Oboe Solo

142
00:11:37.254 --> 00:11:47.254
[MUSIC]

143
00:11:58.796 --> 00:12:03.466
A beautiful passage by Beethoven, in which
we get to hear many of the tone colors of

144
00:12:03.466 --> 00:12:05.510
the instruments of the orchestra.

145
00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:09.630
All beautifully played by young people,
18, 19, 20, 21 years old.

146
00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:11.130
Just students.

147
00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:12.240
A soccer or

148
00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:17.210
a football team, in an American football
team each has eleven players on it.

149
00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:20.790
A baseball team, nine, and
a basketball team only five.

150
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:25.130
But a symphony orchestra has upward
of a hundred players participating,

151
00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:26.280
all at once.

152
00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.576
Playing as many as 25
different instruments.

153
00:12:29.576 --> 00:12:31.434
It's intricate.

154
00:12:31.434 --> 00:12:33.030
It's complex.

155
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:37.797
But as we have just heard it can also
be very powerful and very beautiful.
