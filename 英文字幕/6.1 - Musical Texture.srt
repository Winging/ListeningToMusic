[MUSIC]

2
00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:24.910
Music that you hear in the background is,
again,

3
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.285
a bit of Modest Musorgsky's Pictures
at an Exhibition as

4
00:00:28.285 --> 00:00:30.725
orchestrated by Maurice Revell.

5
00:00:30.725 --> 00:00:33.245
We've talked about rhythm,
melody, harmony,

6
00:00:33.245 --> 00:00:35.995
tone color, in our course thus far.

7
00:00:35.995 --> 00:00:39.345
Today we are going to talk about texture,
form, and style.

8
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.870
Let's begin with texture,
what's texture in music?

9
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.340
Well it's the disposition of
the materials, or otherwise said,

10
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.480
the placement of the sounds.

11
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.460
Following the theme of pictures at
an exhibition let's look at two.

12
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.010
To the left we have Pete Mondrian,

13
00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.950
a more less equal distribution of
vertical and horizontal lines.

14
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.410
We'll be saying the same thing about
musical lines in musical textures

15
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:06.680
in a moment.

16
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.480
And while there are blotches
of colors around the side,

17
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.160
the middle has a wide open texture.

18
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.360
We'll be saying the same thing
about the music of Aaron Copeland,

19
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.024
composer of Appalachian Spring,
Aaron Copeland, later in our course.

20
00:01:21.024 --> 00:01:23.970
Georgia O'Keeffe's Clouds is to the right.

21
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.870
Heavy and ponderous at the bottom,
light and airy and fast moving at the top.

22
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:35.330
Music too fast moving melody on top and
a slower base and harmony beneath.

23
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.800
That also is a common texture.

24
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.260
Musical sounds, too,
can be arranged in different ways.

25
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.310
In music we say that we have three kinds
of textures, three basic textures.

26
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.580
Monophonic, homophonic, and polyphonic.

27
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.950
In truth, the distinction between
the textures, is not always clearcut.

28
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.590
Sometimes the music is midway
between homophonic and

29
00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.170
polyphonic texture, up in the gray area.

30
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.790
But understanding these basic types,
monophonic, homophonic, and polyphonic,

31
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.000
allows us to understand how texture
works in the most basic sort of ways.

32
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.840
Let's start with monophonic texture.

33
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.650
Monophonic conveys the idea of one, from
the Greek word monos, meaning just one.

34
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.880
With monophonic texture,
we get only one sound.

35
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.834
As we hear here with the tune,
Are You Sleeping, or Frere Jacques.

36
00:02:28.834 --> 00:02:36.523
[MUSIC]

37
00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:37.866
And so on.

38
00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:43.098
If men and women sing the same tune
together in octaves, we still have,

39
00:02:43.098 --> 00:02:50.102
[MUSIC].

40
00:02:50.102 --> 00:02:53.314
We still have monophonic texture,
monophonic music,

41
00:02:53.314 --> 00:02:56.880
because the same letter names
would be used for the pitches.

42
00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.040
And the pitch intervals that
are involved would be exactly the same,

43
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.030
moving along higher or lower in lock step.

44
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.330
It's still monophonic texture.

45
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.500
Supposing now, I supported
the melody with chords beneath,

46
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.600
creating an accompanying harmony.

47
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.850
That gives us homophonic texture,
same sounding texture.

48
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.837
Homophonic texture is usually
generated by homorhythms,

49
00:03:22.837 --> 00:03:25.797
rhythms with pitches of the same duration.

50
00:03:25.797 --> 00:03:30.703
That gives the appearance of everything
changing at the same time in lockstep.

51
00:03:30.703 --> 00:03:35.698
On the screen the same melody is
now supported by chords changing

52
00:03:35.698 --> 00:03:37.096
at the same time.

53
00:03:37.096 --> 00:03:43.317
[MUSIC]

54
00:03:43.317 --> 00:03:43.990
And so on.

55
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.360
Lets see now how this sounds in music for
an orchestra.

56
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.890
Lets listen to the beginning of
Musorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition.

57
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.390
We'll hear a solo instrument play
a melody, and then that instrument plays

58
00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:04.160
again, but now joined by other members
of that same instrumental family.

59
00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.790
As you listen, ask yourself, what's
the solo instrument that's playing here?

60
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.560
And what is the family of instruments
that responds to each solo call?

61
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:24.560
[MUSIC]

62
00:04:48.137 --> 00:04:49.935
And you're right.

63
00:04:49.935 --> 00:04:54.905
The melody is first played in monophonic
texture by a trumpet and then repeated

64
00:04:54.905 --> 00:04:59.425
with support of the brass section,
in chords, homophonic texture again.

65
00:05:00.445 --> 00:05:03.035
At the end,
the members of the string family entered,

66
00:05:03.035 --> 00:05:06.005
but still playing in homophonic texture.

67
00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.750
Finally, polyphonic texture.

68
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.370
Obviously here we have the idea
of many sounding texture.

69
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.230
Here the lines are much more independent
mainly because the rhythms are also

70
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:20.170
independent.

71
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.780
So let's go back to Frere Jacques.

72
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.070
And you can see the individual lines here.

73
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.953
I can try to play it.

74
00:05:25.953 --> 00:05:35.953
[MUSIC]

75
00:05:38.437 --> 00:05:41.410
And it gets a little bit tricky,
but you get the idea.

76
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.471
The fact that it is
a little more complicated

77
00:05:44.471 --> 00:05:49.780
suggests that polyphonic texture
is the most complex texture.

78
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.760
For that reason, it was preferred by
composer J.S. Bach, whose music is

79
00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:00.430
in many ways the most complex of
all the great classic composers.

80
00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.200
Here's a slide image of old Bach,
painted toward the end of his life.

81
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.330
Actually, it's the only authentic
representation of Bach that we have.

82
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.400
And here's the way Bach
generates polyphonic texture

83
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.440
in a complex form called the fugue.

84
00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.620
The fugue is an example of imitative
polyphonic texture because as

85
00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.730
each line enters, it duplicates, at least
at the beginning, the preceding line.

86
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.820
Then each line breaks away and
goes in it's own direction.

87
00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.570
If the voice is entered and
imitated exactly from beginning to end,

88
00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:38.130
we would have a round,
like Frere Jacques, or Three Blind Mice.

89
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:44.320
In classical music,
we use the highfalutin word cannon

90
00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.930
to mean round, cannon or
round, interchangeable.

91
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.825
But what you're about to hear is a fugue,

92
00:06:51.825 --> 00:06:57.430
after the opening with the exact
imitation each voice goes its own way.

93
00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:01.130
We'll come back to fugues
later on in our course.

94
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:05.175
But let's begin with one here by Bach.

95
00:07:05.175 --> 00:07:15.175
[MUSIC]

96
00:08:10.072 --> 00:08:14.785
These musical video creations are
wonderful, and I am indebted to my friend

97
00:08:14.785 --> 00:08:18.468
Steve Malinowski,
creator of Music Animation Machine for

98
00:08:18.468 --> 00:08:23.204
allowing me to put this up for free and
have everyone hear, see, and enjoy.

99
00:08:23.204 --> 00:08:26.430
And we'll be using more of
Steve's creations as we proceed.

100
00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:32.320
How do we recognize the difference between
these three essential musical textures?

101
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:36.430
Well, monophonic texture is
perhaps the easiest to hear.

102
00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:37.920
It's just the melody.

103
00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:41.470
Homophonic texture sounds
mainly like a melody but

104
00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:43.450
here you have additional sounds.

105
00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:47.370
The body of the music just sounds fuller,
sounds richer.

106
00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:50.360
If you hear a lot going on in the music,
however,

107
00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:54.845
indeed if your mind is really challenged,
maybe even confounded

108
00:08:54.845 --> 00:08:59.325
by all that's going on,
then likely you have polyphonic texture.

109
00:08:59.325 --> 00:09:01.155
It's the most complex.

110
00:09:02.995 --> 00:09:08.425
As a test of our ability to hear musical
textures, let's turn to a famous piece.

111
00:09:08.425 --> 00:09:13.973
Handel's Hallelujah chorus from
his curatorial Messiah, 1742.

112
00:09:13.973 --> 00:09:17.075
Here we see Handel holding
the score of Messiah.

113
00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:23.950
In the Hallelujah chorus the composer
quickly juxtaposes all three textures.

114
00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:27.670
In fact, this piece is
something of a final exam for

115
00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:29.895
identifying musical textures.

116
00:09:29.895 --> 00:09:31.530
You heard it many times but

117
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:35.430
likely not thought about
the musical textures involved.

118
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:38.678
I'll call them out as we proceed.
