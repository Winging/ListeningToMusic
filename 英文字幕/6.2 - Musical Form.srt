00:00:05.862 --> 00:00:09.227
On the screen you see a picture
of a church in Munich, Germany,

2
00:00:09.227 --> 00:00:12.910
right across the street from
the Munich Opera House.

3
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.580
Certainly it has a form to it, it is
very symmetrical, a symmetrical form.

4
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.740
You could fold the right half
back over the left half and

5
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.280
they would exactly overlap.

6
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.510
The point is that we have form,
of course, in architecture.

7
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.030
Here the facade of the church creates
something akin to A, B, A form.

8
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.610
Tower, pediment, tower.

9
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.560
Here now are three scenes of Madonna,
child and the young St. John the Baptist.

10
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.960
Clearly, each one is constructed
within the impetus of a triangle.

11
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.633
Here of course, there is form in painting.

12
00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:52.370
But what about music?

13
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.140
You can't touch it.

14
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.340
You can't see it.

15
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.670
It's invisible.

16
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.680
So how can you have form in music?

17
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.788
Well you can create form in music
by arranging the musical events in

18
00:01:02.788 --> 00:01:05.697
a particular order as
the piece unfolds in time.

19
00:01:05.697 --> 00:01:09.427
In other words, you could repeat
blocks of sound, a melody,

20
00:01:09.427 --> 00:01:14.114
a striking texture, an exciting chord
progression, these are all events.

21
00:01:14.114 --> 00:01:19.972
And a composer can arrange them in
one of several different patterns and

22
00:01:19.972 --> 00:01:23.140
thereby create an aural form.

23
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.590
Instead of seeing the form all at once,

24
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.970
you experience it,
you hear it as events pass by in time.

25
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.940
Form in music is fashioned by statement,
by repetition,

26
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.510
by contrast and by variation.

27
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.860
Statement, repetition,
contrast and variation.

28
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.990
Looking back over the history of music,
we see that using statement,

29
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.430
repetition, contrast and variation,
five common patterns of musical form,

30
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.309
have come to dominate
music over the centuries.

31
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.602
They are, as you can see here
on the screen, strophic, binary,

32
00:02:02.602 --> 00:02:08.310
ternary, rondo, and theme and variations.

33
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.075
There are other forms in music.

34
00:02:11.075 --> 00:02:13.152
Fugue and sonata allegro among them.

35
00:02:13.152 --> 00:02:15.961
And we'll talk about these
later on in our course.

36
00:02:15.961 --> 00:02:21.440
But for the moment, let's just stick
with these five basic very common forms.

37
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.090
Let's start with strophic form.

38
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.930
If we go all the way back to the very
earliest written secular music in

39
00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.730
Western culture, we come to see the songs
of the troubadours and of the 12th and

40
00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.100
13th centuries.

41
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.927
Already, at least 800 years ago, musicians
were singing songs in strophic form.

42
00:02:41.927 --> 00:02:45.910
On the screen here we see
a troubadour manuscript.

43
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.830
There, at the top left, the title, though
it's a little faint, but I can read it.

44
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.085
Here Commence The Songs of Our Lord.

45
00:02:54.085 --> 00:02:56.433
[FOREIGN].

46
00:02:56.433 --> 00:03:00.830
We have five strophes of text.

47
00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.730
The first of which, shown by the red
arrow, is set beneath the music.

48
00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.430
The remaining four are just written
out as text that you can see here

49
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.250
indicated by the blue arrows, but
they get set to the same music.

50
00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.292
Strophic form still works that way today.

51
00:03:19.292 --> 00:03:24.260
You have a poem that consists of
the succession of strophes, or stanzas.

52
00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.490
These words, strophes and
stanza are interchangeable.

53
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.530
And you set the first strophe to a song,
a melody.

54
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.676
Then you go on to set the next
strophe of your poem.

55
00:03:34.676 --> 00:03:37.950
And you put that to the same melody and so

56
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.590
on throughout the remaining strophes or
stanzas.

57
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.470
So with strophic form, you set a text with
many strophes to one and the same music.

58
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.490
Actually we do the same with
hymns that are sung in church or

59
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.170
universities or
commencements, even weddings.

60
00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.350
There are many stanza's of a hymn but
they are sung to the same music.

61
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.980
So strophic form can be represented as A,
A, A, A, A and so on.

62
00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.870
Because all of the music is the same.

63
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:13.100
On the screen you see equivalent
of strophic form in architecture.

64
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.690
The outdoor rotunda of the Esterhazy
Estate where composer Josef Haydn

65
00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.500
worked in the 18th century.

66
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.220
Each of the units, the columns,
repeats without a variation.

67
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.462
Let's explore a very simple
example of strophic form in music.

68
00:04:30.462 --> 00:04:36.410
The famous Lullaby created by Johannes
Brahms in the middle of the 19th century.

69
00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.170
It starts with a lilting
piano accompaniment,

70
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.270
a harmony, before the melody
enters with a female voice.

71
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.676
As if a mother were singing
her child to sleep.

72
00:04:46.676 --> 00:04:50.498
[MUSIC]

73
00:04:50.498 --> 00:04:51.357
Here's the introduction.

74
00:04:51.357 --> 00:05:01.357
>> [MUSIC]

75
00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:39.342
>> End this strophe,
piano introduction again, second strophe.

76
00:05:39.342 --> 00:05:49.342
>> [MUSIC]

77
00:06:25.887 --> 00:06:27.687
>> Watched over by angels indeed.

78
00:06:27.687 --> 00:06:29.670
Very beautiful.

79
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:35.080
Surprisingly, although the form goes all
the way back to at least the middle ages,

80
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.970
most pop songs today are still
written in strophic form.

81
00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:43.090
But often in a slightly more
complex version of strophic form.

82
00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.020
The first part is what we've
come to call the verse, and

83
00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.470
the second, the concluding part,
the chorus.

84
00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:53.600
Originally, in the Middle Ages, it appears
that a chorus did join in for what came

85
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.760
to be called, [LAUGH] not unsurprisingly,
the chorus part of the song.

86
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:04.860
The chorus that ends each strophe is
always the same, it's a textural refrain.

87
00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.010
But, the text of each verse is new.

88
00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:09.180
Let's see how this works.

89
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.080
I've chosen a song that I've always liked,
The City of New Orleans,

90
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:19.220
made popular by modern day troubadour,
Arlo Guthrie.

91
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.080
Something, as they say,
of a modern day troubadour.

92
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:25.990
But the song was originally written
by a one Steven Goodwin, and

93
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:29.450
it's been covered by more
than 50 singers over time.

94
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:35.510
Arlo Guthrie, just producing the best
known version of these covers.

95
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:40.350
It's a great poem, actually, about
hard time in the heartland of America.

96
00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:44.470
By the way, the beginning of the chorus,
good morning america, how are you was

97
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:49.800
taken and turned into the title of the ABC
morning show, Good Morning, America.

98
00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.671
The song starts with
an instrumental lead in.

99
00:07:53.671 --> 00:07:57.588
Once the train gets rolling you can
hear it rolling in the accompaniment.

100
00:07:57.588 --> 00:08:01.504
[SOUND] in the background.

101
00:08:01.504 --> 00:08:05.740
I've highlighted in red two
key moments of the chorus.

102
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:13.456
A great use of syncopation, that's the
first one and then an unexpected cortal

103
00:08:13.456 --> 00:08:19.511
shift in the harmony which gives us a sort
of harmonic shiver on the word gone.

104
00:08:19.511 --> 00:08:22.772
Let me see if I can reconstruct
some of this on the piano.

105
00:08:22.772 --> 00:08:32.772
[MUSIC]

106
00:08:39.783 --> 00:08:40.945
There's that chord.

107
00:08:40.945 --> 00:08:48.861
[MUSIC]

108
00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:51.112
So be on the lookout for
the syncopation and

109
00:08:51.112 --> 00:08:52.292
[MUSIC]

110
00:08:52.292 --> 00:08:57.125
that surprise chord there in the chorus.

111
00:08:57.125 --> 00:08:59.104
Let's hear it.

112
00:08:59.104 --> 00:09:09.104
[MUSIC]

113
00:09:26.306 --> 00:09:27.890
>> Shift to the minor.

114
00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:37.890
[MUSIC]

115
00:10:02.121 --> 00:10:03.303
>> Syncopation.

116
00:10:03.303 --> 00:10:13.303
[MUSIC]

117
00:10:17.518 --> 00:10:22.725
That's just the first and chorus and
there are two others that follow.

118
00:10:22.725 --> 00:10:23.823
It's a great song.
Indeed,

119
00:10:23.823 --> 00:10:30.080
I submit that that song's belongs in
the pantheon of great American songs.

120
00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:34.170
The heartland of America during
the decline of the railroads, but

121
00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:37.190
oddly enough that train is
still running on Amtrak today,

122
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:41.690
900 miles from Chicago through Memphis,
to New Orleans.

123
00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:47.870
So we've have two lullabies,
one written in strophic form,

124
00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:51.280
by the 19th century German
composer Johann Brahms and

125
00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:57.450
the other is by with verse and
chorus structure.

126
00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:00.400
Which is better, which do you enjoy more?

127
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.458
I'd like to know, send me an email.

128
00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:09.284
But every pop singer has sung songs
in this sort of strophic form,

129
00:11:09.284 --> 00:11:15.970
verse plus chorus, Taylor Swift,
Lady Gaga, Brad Paisley, Adele, everyone.

130
00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:20.710
To be sure, strophic form is
the world's most popular musical form.

131
00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:24.410
All right.

132
00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:26.670
On now to theme and variations.

133
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:33.400
Instead of having the music come back,
exactly the same way each time.

134
00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.020
It changes with each appearance.

135
00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:40.460
One and the same idea
continually modified or varied.

136
00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:46.260
And as you can see here in the bottom, we
have that arranged in terms of shapes and

137
00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:51.210
then we're going to turn to the Sydney
Opera House where I have labeled

138
00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:55.250
the various sails of the roof
of the opera house A,

139
00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:58.860
A prime, A double prime and so on.

140
00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:06.500
Theme and variation also goes back
deep into a recorded history.

141
00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:09.790
Classical composers have
frequently made used of it

142
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:15.110
as had instrumentalist playing popular
music, in jazz musicians in particular.

143
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:20.098
Here are two quick examples, the first
is a popular song from the Renaissance.

144
00:12:20.098 --> 00:12:21.853
Greensleeves.

145
00:12:21.853 --> 00:12:26.142
There was a melody built
on a recurring harmony and

146
00:12:26.142 --> 00:12:31.870
as each time the harmony
appeared the performer

147
00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:37.090
would alter the melody improvising
a new version each time.

148
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:40.016
So the harmony essentially goes.

149
00:12:40.016 --> 00:12:50.016
[MUSIC]

150
00:13:27.443 --> 00:13:29.015
And so on.

151
00:13:29.015 --> 00:13:33.009
Well if I had any talent,
I could really do a good job with that.

152
00:13:33.009 --> 00:13:37.423
But that's what jazz musicians do,
jazz trumpeters like Chris Botti and

153
00:13:37.423 --> 00:13:38.810
Wynton Marsalis.

154
00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:42.474
They take a well known tune,
called a standard, Greensleeves.

155
00:13:42.474 --> 00:13:45.286
[MUSIC]

156
00:13:45.286 --> 00:13:48.080
Is a standard of the 16th century.

157
00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:52.220
They'd take a standard such as Somewhere
Over the Rainbow or When I Fall in Love,

158
00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:53.650
and they'd repeat again and

159
00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:57.730
again jazzing it up,
varying the melody at each appearance.

160
00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:06.420
Now here's a second, very straightforward
version of theme and variation form.

161
00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:08.390
It was created by Mozart.

162
00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:11.290
In the setting of a song that
we all know today as Twinkle,

163
00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:14.930
Twinkle Little Star or
maybe Bah, Bah Black Sheep.

164
00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:17.860
Actually, it was originally
a french folk song

165
00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:20.460
that Mozart heard on a trip to France.

166
00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:24.280
To see what Mozart did
with this now famous tune,

167
00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.610
lets turn to a live class demonstration.

168
00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:31.019
>> And here is the melody.

169
00:14:31.019 --> 00:14:34.482
[MUSIC]

170
00:14:34.482 --> 00:14:36.660
And here's the first variation.

171
00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:38.658
Now my question to you is this [COUGH].

172
00:14:38.658 --> 00:14:43.835
With theme and variation, the composer
can keep the theme more or less exactly

173
00:14:43.835 --> 00:14:48.551
as it is, and change the context
around it, or he can change the theme.

174
00:14:48.551 --> 00:14:51.401
So which does Mozart do
in the first variation?

175
00:14:51.401 --> 00:15:01.401
[MUSIC]

176
00:15:05.362 --> 00:15:06.204
Thoughts about that?

177
00:15:06.204 --> 00:15:12.796
Is he changing the theme or is he keeping
the theme and changing stuff around it.

178
00:15:12.796 --> 00:15:13.825
What do you think?

179
00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.573
Well, what he's doing
is changing the theme.

180
00:15:17.573 --> 00:15:18.401
The theme would go.

181
00:15:18.401 --> 00:15:20.342
[MUSIC]

182
00:15:20.342 --> 00:15:21.521
But right at the beginning instead of.

183
00:15:21.521 --> 00:15:22.082
[MUSIC]

184
00:15:22.082 --> 00:15:22.647
I get.

185
00:15:22.647 --> 00:15:24.690
[MUSIC]

186
00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:28.688
So there's only really one note
that relates to the theme there.

187
00:15:28.688 --> 00:15:29.242
And then.

188
00:15:29.242 --> 00:15:29.864
[MUSIC]

189
00:15:29.864 --> 00:15:30.617
Well, now I get.

190
00:15:30.617 --> 00:15:31.722
[MUSIC]

191
00:15:31.722 --> 00:15:36.310
So he sort of changing the theme by making
the notes go quicker in ornamenting

192
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:37.780
around those notes.

193
00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:40.880
So that's variation one
what about variation two?

194
00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:45.045
Does he change the theme or does he just
change all the stuff around the theme?

195
00:15:45.045 --> 00:15:55.045
[MUSIC]

196
00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:10.620
[MUSIC]

197
00:16:12.125 --> 00:16:13.055
And so on.

198
00:16:13.055 --> 00:16:14.610
So what's he doing there?

199
00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:15.994
Caroline?

200
00:16:15.994 --> 00:16:18.026
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> Changing what?

201
00:16:18.026 --> 00:16:19.232
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.

202
00:16:19.232 --> 00:16:20.800
>> Changing the context.

203
00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:21.770
Changing the context.

204
00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:24.530
The theme in the right hand
stays exactly the same.

205
00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:26.591
[MUSIC]

206
00:16:26.591 --> 00:16:28.460
Okay, here is the next one.

207
00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:31.527
[MUSIC]

208
00:16:31.527 --> 00:16:32.282
What's that?

209
00:16:32.282 --> 00:16:33.744
Well, it goes with this.

210
00:16:33.744 --> 00:16:43.744
[MUSIC]

211
00:16:47.226 --> 00:16:48.422
So has he changed the theme?

212
00:16:48.422 --> 00:16:50.801
Yeah, he's changed the theme
rather considerably there.

213
00:16:50.801 --> 00:16:51.660
Indeed.

214
00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:54.620
[MUSIC]

215
00:16:54.620 --> 00:17:00.591
We wouldn't know that had anything to
do with Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star,

216
00:17:00.591 --> 00:17:05.482
unless we had had given to us
previously as we have, the melody.

217
00:17:05.482 --> 00:17:06.480
[MUSIC]

218
00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:11.478
So we are hearing

219
00:17:11.478 --> 00:17:16.837
in our inner ear.

220
00:17:16.837 --> 00:17:17.464
[MUSIC]

221
00:17:17.464 --> 00:17:20.994
So we know that's the basis of this.

222
00:17:20.994 --> 00:17:24.085
And if he wants to deviate from that,
we can still say oh, yeah,

223
00:17:24.085 --> 00:17:25.359
that's related to that.

224
00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:30.214
That's getting rather far away from
the original because we sort of locked in

225
00:17:30.214 --> 00:17:32.909
the original in our on
my ear at that point.

226
00:17:32.909 --> 00:17:37.322
And then oddly the final,

227
00:17:37.322 --> 00:17:42.738
the final variation, what does

228
00:17:42.738 --> 00:17:49.860
he do to the meter in this last variation?

229
00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:53.889
[MUSIC]

230
00:17:53.889 --> 00:17:55.062
What happens there?

231
00:17:55.062 --> 00:18:00.808
We were going.
[MUSIC]

232
00:18:00.808 --> 00:18:04.093
So what's he done to the meter?

233
00:18:04.093 --> 00:18:09.520
Well, let me strip away the bass.

234
00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:18.959
[MUSIC]

235
00:18:18.959 --> 00:18:23.279
Is changed into triple,
by throwing in an extra

236
00:18:23.279 --> 00:18:28.247
bar of filler in between each
of his basic duple beats.

237
00:18:28.247 --> 00:18:35.212
Then we come to, maybe,
let me just cut to the chase here.

238
00:18:35.212 --> 00:18:40.982
At the end of this,

239
00:18:40.982 --> 00:18:46.400
he's coming in.

240
00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.182
[MUSIC]

241
00:18:48.182 --> 00:18:48.786
What's this?

242
00:18:48.786 --> 00:18:49.645
All the way to the end now.

243
00:18:49.645 --> 00:18:56.023
What do we call

244
00:18:56.023 --> 00:19:03.469
this formally?

245
00:19:03.469 --> 00:19:06.058
[MUSIC]

246
00:19:06.058 --> 00:19:09.460
We talked about that with
regard to Sonata-Allegro form.

247
00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:12.600
It's one of the parts that shows
up also in Sonata-Allegro form

248
00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.490
has nothing to do really
with the theme here.

249
00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:17.820
It is a good example of a coda.

250
00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:22.006
Right, just something thrown on at
the end to say this is the end.

251
00:19:22.006 --> 00:19:27.081
[MUSIC]

252
00:19:27.081 --> 00:19:27.804
And what's he doing here?

253
00:19:27.804 --> 00:19:32.905
What is this?
How complex is this?

254
00:19:32.905 --> 00:19:36.296
[MUSIC]

255
00:19:36.296 --> 00:19:40.145
It's just a major triad.

256
00:19:40.145 --> 00:19:42.175
He's just ornamenting a major triad.

257
00:19:42.175 --> 00:19:43.895
So it's more cadential stuff.

258
00:19:43.895 --> 00:19:46.505
Sort of very simple material at the end.

259
00:19:46.505 --> 00:19:48.575
>> So there a there at the end
of that class session,

260
00:19:48.575 --> 00:19:52.115
that guy was talking about
the idea of a coda in music.

261
00:19:52.115 --> 00:19:56.750
Coda is the simple Italian word for
tail, end.

262
00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:59.340
Okay, let's go on now to binary form.

263
00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:05.173
Here on the screen you see two
sculptures of the late British sculptor,

264
00:20:05.173 --> 00:20:06.970
Barbra Hepworth.

265
00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:10.900
The one to the left is actually in the art
gallery of the Northwestern University

266
00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:11.550
campus.

267
00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:17.840
Although they are different,
each represents an example of binary form.

268
00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:21.310
In each sculpture we have two parts,
but they're not the same.

269
00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:25.720
They are equal entities that
compliment and complete one another.

270
00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:31.320
As you can imagine, you get that same
idea, that same process in music as well.

271
00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:35.730
In music, we call it just a b,
or binary form.

272
00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:39.640
Let's listen to a famous
melody again by JS Bach.

273
00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.670
Now in binary form.

274
00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:43.990
It's his Air on a G string, so

275
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:48.030
titled because someone in the nineteenth
century arranged the melody to be

276
00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:52.780
played entirely on the G string,
the lowest string of the violin.

277
00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:57.500
Anyway, the piece is in
a clear binary form.

278
00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:03.700
This animated music video that we
are about to see was, again, done and

279
00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:10.360
made available to us by Steve Millonausky
and musical animation machine.

280
00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:11.990
I'll comment as we go along.

281
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:21.990
[MUSIC]

282
00:21:24.616 --> 00:21:28.871
We see that the bass has a steady

283
00:21:28.871 --> 00:21:34.490
pulse proceeding in eighth notes.

284
00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:37.800
That's neither here nor there, but
you can hear the steady beat underneath.

285
00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:44.115
[MUSIC]

286
00:21:44.115 --> 00:21:52.180
And the upper parts engage a light
sort of form of polyphonic texture.

287
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:54.860
Here's the end of the a section.

288
00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:57.260
The bass now moves
a little bit more quickly.

289
00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:02.960
Now he's going to repeat
the same material all over again.

290
00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:12.960
[MUSIC]

291
00:22:22.377 --> 00:22:27.265
First and second violins,
top and next to the top part,

292
00:22:27.265 --> 00:22:29.980
engage in a musical dialogue.

293
00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:39.980
[MUSIC]

294
00:22:43.732 --> 00:22:48.140
End of the a section,
now onto the b section.

295
00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:48.932
[MUSIC]

296
00:22:48.932 --> 00:22:51.209
Part two.

297
00:22:51.209 --> 00:22:55.696
[MUSIC]

298
00:22:55.696 --> 00:23:01.666
Now the next to bottom part
is a little more aggressively

299
00:23:01.666 --> 00:23:06.374
into the imitation and into the polyphony.

300
00:23:06.374 --> 00:23:11.253
All the while, the bass just

301
00:23:11.253 --> 00:23:16.744
keeps plodding along with it's

302
00:23:16.744 --> 00:23:21.230
steady eighth note line.

303
00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:31.230
[MUSIC]

304
00:23:39.124 --> 00:23:40.296
Bringing into a climax.

305
00:23:40.296 --> 00:23:50.296
[MUSIC]

306
00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:10.754
And here's the end of

307
00:24:10.754 --> 00:24:16.748
[MUSIC]

308
00:24:16.748 --> 00:24:22.060
The B section, but
Bach wants to repeat that B section,

309
00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:25.676
just as he had repeated the A section.

310
00:24:25.676 --> 00:24:30.901
[MUSIC]

311
00:24:30.901 --> 00:24:36.712
As we noted there, in this performance,
and as Bach wanted, both the A section and

312
00:24:36.712 --> 00:24:41.279
the B section were repeated,
producing an A-A-B-B form, but

313
00:24:41.279 --> 00:24:45.490
it's still thought of simply as binary or
A-B form.

314
00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:50.290
But repeating the sections makes this
gorgeous piece by Bach last longer, and

315
00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:51.897
who wouldn't like that?

316
00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:57.170
Okay, on to Turner reform.

317
00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:01.340
Firmly believing that a picture
is worth a thousand words,

318
00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:05.010
here's an example of Turner
reform in architecture.

319
00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:08.240
It's Mozart's church,
the Cathedral of Salzburg.

320
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:17.320
With Turner reform in music, it's helpful
to think of home, away, home, or A-B-A.

321
00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:22.900
Now, for more complete explanation of
Turner reform, again with a change of key

322
00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:28.012
in the middle B section, let's turn
to a class video where I talk about

323
00:25:28.012 --> 00:25:34.310
Turner reform in a piece by Beethoven, the
beginning section of his famous Fur Elise.

324
00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:39.696
So, we have this piece in
Turner reform by Beethoven, and

325
00:25:39.696 --> 00:25:44.988
Turner reform conveys to us simply
the idea of presentation, diversion,

326
00:25:44.988 --> 00:25:51.204
representation or statement digression,
restatement, anything like this, we like

327
00:25:51.204 --> 00:25:56.765
to diagram these in terms of alphabetical
letters you can think just A-B-A.

328
00:25:56.765 --> 00:26:06.765
[MUSIC]

329
00:26:14.076 --> 00:26:15.676
All right, I'm going to pause here.

330
00:26:15.676 --> 00:26:16.567
We started out here.

331
00:26:16.567 --> 00:26:19.119
[MUSIC]

332
00:26:19.119 --> 00:26:20.250
We are in this key.

333
00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:23.078
Major or minor, what do you think?

334
00:26:23.078 --> 00:26:24.370
Minor.
All right, so

335
00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:26.460
we were coming to the end
of this A section.

336
00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:27.750
Here the A section is very short.

337
00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:37.025
[MUSIC]

338
00:26:37.025 --> 00:26:37.756
But then,

339
00:26:37.756 --> 00:26:41.361
[MUSIC]

340
00:26:41.361 --> 00:26:43.085
we, major or minor?

341
00:26:43.085 --> 00:26:43.970
Major, okay.

342
00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:46.050
So, what happened there?
What do we call this?

343
00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:52.630
It's a very quick modulation,
a very quick modulation.

344
00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:53.880
We've changed keys.

345
00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:57.540
And I'm going to digress here just for
a moment to talk about this,

346
00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:01.590
which is this concept of
relative major and minor.

347
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:06.670
You may have noticed in music, and it's
discussed briefly in the textbook that

348
00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:12.120
there are pairs of keys, pairs of
keys that have something in common.

349
00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:15.740
The members of the pairs
have the same key signature.

350
00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:20.090
We could take any key signature,
three flats, or two sharps, whatever, but

351
00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:26.370
there's gonna be one major key with three
flats and one minor key with three flats.

352
00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:32.030
And I think we have, up on the board here,
an example of just that, so you can see

353
00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:38.010
written in here the three flats, and
this is a minor scale with three flats.

354
00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:40.710
Now, we could also have
three flats over here, but

355
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:44.190
we encounter three flats when
we have the major scale.

356
00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:47.970
This happens to work out,
so that it's pitched on C.

357
00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:53.290
If we come up three half steps in
the keyboard, we come up to E flat.

358
00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:59.700
So, the relative major, the major key in
this pair, is always three half steps.

359
00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:07.070
One, two, three, three half
steps up above its paired minor.

360
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:10.910
Here's another one down at the bottom,
happens to have one sharp in it.

361
00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:13.970
We have the key of G major
here with one sharp, but

362
00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:20.520
if we come down three half steps,
we get it's relative minor down here.

363
00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:24.920
And the reason I mention this is not
because we actually hear this very much.

364
00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:29.400
I'm not sure that I hear modulations
to relative major, because I don't have

365
00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:33.210
absolute pitch, and I'm not tracking
keys when I listen to pieces.

366
00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:34.740
My guess is that you're not either.

367
00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:39.378
So, for the average listener, we may not
hear the actual pitch relationship, but

368
00:28:39.378 --> 00:28:41.896
we may hear that we've had a modulation,
and

369
00:28:41.896 --> 00:28:46.002
you can kind of make an educated guess
that about 50% of the time if it's

370
00:28:46.002 --> 00:28:49.909
going minor to major, it's coming
in this relative arrangement, or

371
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:53.588
major down to minor,
it's going in this relative arrangement.

372
00:28:53.588 --> 00:28:55.169
So, this happens a lot.

373
00:28:55.169 --> 00:29:01.193
So here we are in the mid section
of our Turner reform, A-B-A.

374
00:29:01.193 --> 00:29:02.746
Here is the B part.

375
00:29:02.746 --> 00:29:11.194
[MUSIC]

376
00:29:11.194 --> 00:29:13.875
And then back to the minor A.

377
00:29:13.875 --> 00:29:21.813
[MUSIC]

378
00:29:21.813 --> 00:29:26.356
Now, that's just the opening
section of this piece,

379
00:29:26.356 --> 00:29:33.100
it goes on to do other things, but it is
a very succinct example of Turner reform.

380
00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:35.020
Finally, rondo form.

381
00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:38.455
Rondo form involves a simple principle,
a refrain,

382
00:29:38.455 --> 00:29:42.440
theme A,
alternates with contrasting music.

383
00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.920
Usually in a rondo,

384
00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:47.480
there are at least two contrasting
sections that we'll label B and C.

385
00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:49.440
Classical composers and

386
00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:54.610
even a few pop composers have written
pieces in a variety of rondo forms.

387
00:29:54.610 --> 00:30:00.344
On the screen,
you can see three of them, A-B-A-C-A,

388
00:30:00.344 --> 00:30:06.780
A-B-A-C-A-B-A, or
A-B-A-C-A-D-A, for example.

389
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:12.076
Rondo form also appears in architecture,

390
00:30:12.076 --> 00:30:17.190
particularly the A-B-A-C-A-B-A structure,

391
00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:21.040
which is a palindrome, something that goes
backward and forwards at the same time,

392
00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:25.030
like race car or Madam, I am Adam.

393
00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:30.160
Here is my favorite chateau,
actually it's not my favorite chateau, but

394
00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:36.080
it's one of my favorite chateaus, and
it plays out in architecture, rondo form.

395
00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:41.120
I took this picture many years
ago while leaning out of a bus.

396
00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:44.175
It's the Renaissance Chateau,
built by Francis I,

397
00:30:44.175 --> 00:30:48.980
King Francis I, in Chambord in France.

398
00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:53.987
I put the letters on parts of
the chateau to show you the form.

399
00:30:53.987 --> 00:31:00.600
Now, let's see how this plays
out in an example of pop music.

400
00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:04.634
Sting and The Police,
Every Breath You Take.

401
00:31:04.634 --> 00:31:08.126
You see a diagram up here on the screen,
and

402
00:31:08.126 --> 00:31:12.595
I'm gonna talk through this
a little bit as we hear it.

403
00:31:12.595 --> 00:31:16.958
So let's start it out, and
we'll begin here in the A section.

404
00:31:16.958 --> 00:31:21.954
[MUSIC]

405
00:31:21.954 --> 00:31:23.572
Here we are in our tonic.

406
00:31:23.572 --> 00:31:25.193
[MUSIC]
One chord,

407
00:31:25.193 --> 00:31:28.156
[MUSIC]

408
00:31:28.156 --> 00:31:33.868
minor cord goes into the sixth degree of
the scale, and one goes on the fourth

409
00:31:33.868 --> 00:31:39.595
degree of the scale, and comes back in,
but not back to the expected tonic.

410
00:31:39.595 --> 00:31:44.655
There is deceived, a deceptive cadence,
but now it's gonna cycle again.

411
00:31:44.655 --> 00:31:51.985
There's our six chord,
four chord built on the fifth degree.

412
00:31:53.375 --> 00:31:54.985
Okay, back to the tonic.

413
00:31:54.985 --> 00:31:56.944
Now here comes our B section.

414
00:31:56.944 --> 00:31:58.609
[MUSIC]

415
00:31:58.609 --> 00:32:04.700
>> Moving to a different
accompanying level,

416
00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:10.131
coming around back to five chord here,

417
00:32:10.131 --> 00:32:16.562
setting up for
return back to original tonic.

418
00:32:16.562 --> 00:32:17.420
Six

419
00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:20.819
[MUSIC]

420
00:32:20.819 --> 00:32:21.808
four

421
00:32:21.808 --> 00:32:23.825
[MUSIC]

422
00:32:23.825 --> 00:32:24.575
five.

423
00:32:24.575 --> 00:32:26.640
Okay, so that's how this plays out.

424
00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:30.120
Now, let's go back to our
slide of the chateau.

425
00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:33.030
Now we've worked our way
past the second day.

426
00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:37.430
We're gonna go on to here
a radically different section,

427
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:41.600
C section,
where there's a bold harmonic shift.

428
00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:45.043
So, let's listen to that, and
then we'll go on from there.

429
00:32:45.043 --> 00:32:55.043
[MUSIC]

430
00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:15.028
Now, it jumps back to the original tonic,
and

431
00:33:15.028 --> 00:33:20.414
the A idea has returned, but
now there are no lyrics,

432
00:33:20.414 --> 00:33:25.202
just the harmonic pattern,
and it fades out and

433
00:33:25.202 --> 00:33:30.590
eventually ends,
after revisiting the B section and

434
00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:34.720
a final return to the initial A.

435
00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.160
Nice chateau, nice song.

436
00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:42.120
Well, I find our segment on musical
form is already overly long, so

437
00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:47.610
we'll postpone Mr. Mozart and his famous
Rondo alla Turca until our session

438
00:33:47.610 --> 00:33:53.230
on musical form in the classical
era of Mozart and Haydn.

439
00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:54.573
We'll listen to it then.
