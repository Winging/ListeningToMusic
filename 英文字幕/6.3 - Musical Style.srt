00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.640
When you walk around downtown Chicago,
you see many architectural styles.

2
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:18.460
Here 1960s office buildings rest behind
the spectacular Prtizker Music Pavillion

3
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.040
designed in a far more modern
style by architect Frank Gehry.

4
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.770
Similarly, when you walk into
an art museum and enter a gallery,

5
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.280
you often have to make an educated
guess as to what you're seeing,

6
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.480
you're not close enough to actually
be able to read the picture labels.

7
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.171
Is it medieval, or is it modern?

8
00:00:43.171 --> 00:00:48.050
Actually it's something of a fun game to
play, name that picture or more correctly,

9
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.690
identify that style.

10
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.170
What's the style,
what's the style period of the painting?

11
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.200
Here we've got Medieval of course
to the left, modern to the right.

12
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.120
Well, we do the same thing in music.

13
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.220
We walk into Starbucks and
hear music played, or riding in a car and

14
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.240
turning on the radio, or sitting in an
airplane and click on that audio button.

15
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.750
But what are we then hearing?

16
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.660
Is it Bach or Mozart?

17
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.850
Beyonce or Bono?

18
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.440
Unless we happen to know the particular
piece, we have to guess,

19
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.340
we have to make an educated
guess based on style.

20
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.930
Cultural historians use the term style

21
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.200
to refer to common attributes
among works of art.

22
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.380
This allows us to match it or
not match it with other works.

23
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.640
And that's what we're doing when
we look at an unknown painting or

24
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.370
listen to an unknown piece of music, we're
trying to match it up with what we know.

25
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.750
Oddly enough, Internet sites such as
Pandora and the newer iTunes Radio

26
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.660
make use of an awareness
of musical style as well,

27
00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.630
to give you more of
the style that you like.

28
00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.020
You choose a piece of listen to, and while
you're listening, the computer is mining

29
00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.470
data about the piece, and then is matching
that data to other pieces with similar

30
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.700
style features, and that's how
the site suggests new songs for you.

31
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.640
But what is style in music?

32
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.140
Style in music is the distinctive sound,

33
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.870
the sound that is the totality of all of
the elements of music that we have been

34
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.530
discussing of rhythm, melody, harmony,
and particularly tone color and texture.

35
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.260
The surface details of the music.

36
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.210
Music historians generally divide
the history of Western music

37
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.530
into eight styles, or eight style periods.

38
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.650
We like this idea, historical periods,
it helps us group things,

39
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.500
helps us to see commonalities,
helps us to understand.

40
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.170
Here are the eight style periods
as you can see on the screen,

41
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.620
here are the eight style periods
as generally agreed upon for

42
00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.250
the history of Western classical
music set out in sequence.

43
00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.409
And as you can see Middle Ages,
Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, Romantic,

44
00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:12.630
Impressionist, Modern, Postmodern, and
then there toward the end they begin to

45
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.290
overlap because a composer doesn't wake up
on the 1st of January, slap his forehead,

46
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.300
and say, by golly it's 1900, I've got
to start writing in a modernist mode.

47
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.962
These styles do in fact overlap.

48
00:03:25.046 --> 00:03:30.395
If you're following along our course
with the text book and the website,

49
00:03:30.395 --> 00:03:35.743
you'll have access to a link that
takes you through the various periods,

50
00:03:35.743 --> 00:03:40.833
and the history of music by
an interactive timeline, and it allows you

51
00:03:40.833 --> 00:03:45.950
to play representative samples as
you progress along that timeline.

52
00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.350
So let's see how this game is played.

53
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:55.020
And initially the way I set it up for
the moment,

54
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.680
it progresses along through the history of
music with various graphic representations

55
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.850
and seminal moments in the music
history of that particular period.

56
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.535
Now into the Baroque, the Classical,
and you can see there are various

57
00:04:09.535 --> 00:04:14.065
audio buttons there, that if you
wished you could hit one of those and

58
00:04:14.065 --> 00:04:17.758
you would get a representative
piece from that period.

59
00:04:17.758 --> 00:04:21.113
And I think one is just about to come up,

60
00:04:21.113 --> 00:04:26.015
believe it's John Adams,
Short Ride in a Fast Machine.

61
00:04:26.015 --> 00:04:28.838
[MUSIC]

62
00:04:28.838 --> 00:04:32.048
But you can click on any of these and

63
00:04:32.048 --> 00:04:37.470
representative music of
that period will play out.

64
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.880
In addition to that, we have something
called the checklist of musical styles.

65
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.855
And as you dig more deeply into that,
as we will with

66
00:04:47.855 --> 00:04:53.178
the next slide here,
you can see that here you are given

67
00:04:53.178 --> 00:04:58.171
the history of music broken
down period by period.

68
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.970
And then also you are given
the music of that period,

69
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.770
broken into its component elements,
melody,

70
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.090
harmony, rhythm, color, and texture.

71
00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.220
And you can click on any of these and
you will have a representative sample of

72
00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.680
the melody, the harmony, the rhythm,
the texture of that period.

73
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.286
Here of course we have
Mozart's famous music,

74
00:05:30.286 --> 00:05:33.960
as a representative of classical melody.

75
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.962
Let's go on to melody of
the romantic period now.

76
00:05:36.962 --> 00:05:38.460
[MUSIC]

77
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.405
Here we have the music of
Richard Wagner on his opera, Tristan,

78
00:05:43.405 --> 00:05:48.546
with Isolde singing, working her
way up to a melodic climax here.

79
00:05:48.546 --> 00:05:51.428
[MUSIC]

80
00:05:51.428 --> 00:05:55.456
Well, I have to leave
Isolde hanging there for

81
00:05:55.456 --> 00:06:00.838
the moment as we move on to
the Modern period, Modern melody.

82
00:06:00.838 --> 00:06:10.838
[MUSIC]

83
00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:21.109
And it's very different in terms of
melody, it's highly disjunct, dissonant,

84
00:06:21.109 --> 00:06:21.970
and so on.

85
00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:25.240
So you can work through each of these and
become familiar

86
00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.920
with the different elements of musical
style for all of the historical periods.

87
00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.620
And then finally you can
actually quiz yourself here,

88
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.790
there is a section called
Musical Style Quiz.

89
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.510
So let's see what's involved there.

90
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:45.860
So here you can start out,
the periods are named for you, paired off.

91
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.296
And then we go in and
you can click on any particular button.

92
00:06:49.296 --> 00:06:52.260
[MUSIC]

93
00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.405
Up will come a piece,
and you can click off,

94
00:06:55.405 --> 00:07:00.845
respond to questions regarding to tone,
color, beat, meter, texture,

95
00:07:00.845 --> 00:07:06.030
period in question, the type or
genre of the piece, composer's name,

96
00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:10.280
and you say you're finished,
you're ready to be graded,

97
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:15.610
and there's your score, good for
you, you got them all right.

98
00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:18.440
So for each of the periods
in the history of music,

99
00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.730
we have style quizzes as well,
so go in and explore.

100
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:27.635
Explore the richness of the website that
comes along with this particular textbook.

101
00:07:27.635 --> 00:07:33.080
But let's pretend for a moment we don't
know, we don't know what period we're in.

102
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.080
Let's have a mystery piece here and
see how we do in terms of style.

103
00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.800
So I just pulled one out here,

104
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.510
you listen a bit,
see when you think this piece was written.

105
00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:43.810
What period in history
of music was it written?

106
00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:53.810
[MUSIC]

107
00:08:48.587 --> 00:08:51.320
Okay, let's phase that out here.

108
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:57.450
So here we heard a lovely solo for
the English horn, a low oboe.

109
00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:01.830
Now the English horn wasn't added to
the orchestra until the 19th century,

110
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:02.990
around 1830.

111
00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:06.740
So this piece can't have been
written before the 19th century.

112
00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.060
But at the same time,
it's very consonant, and

113
00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:13.790
it has a lovely scale based melody to it.

114
00:09:14.955 --> 00:09:18.810
Later 20th century music often
has much more dissonance and

115
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:21.820
the melody is often much more disjunct.

116
00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:26.456
So a quick and correct response would be
to this that this piece could not have

117
00:09:26.456 --> 00:09:31.383
been written before the 19th century,
and unlikely to have been written after

118
00:09:31.383 --> 00:09:35.295
the 19th century, so
this is a piece from the 19th century,

119
00:09:35.295 --> 00:09:38.580
from the romantic period
in the history of music.

120
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:44.100
It's the famous Goin' Home melody from
Antonin Dvorak's The New World Symphony.

121
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:49.560
And a sidebar, an excursus on my part.

122
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:55.640
People often misuse the word song when
talking about pieces of orchestral music.

123
00:09:55.640 --> 00:10:01.190
They refer to Dvorak's New World Song or
the Beethoven's Fifth Symphony

124
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:07.330
as Beethoven's Fifth Song or to
Mozart's Piano Concerto as Mozart's Song.

125
00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:11.090
Songs have lyrics, a text that tells
you what the music's about and

126
00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:13.820
suggests how you should
feel about that music, but

127
00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:17.040
most classical pieces
are entirely instrumental.

128
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:21.600
So if it's a classical piece and
it's instrumental, it's not a song,

129
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.690
it's a piece, it's a composition,
a chef d'oeuvre if you were.

130
00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:30.500
A masterpiece, or more specifically,
a symphony or concerto, whatever.

131
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.160
But in the vernacular, it ain't a song.

132
00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:38.540
The difference between classical and
popular styles in music was brought home

133
00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:43.680
to me by something that happened recently
at my university, Yale University.

134
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.660
A group of musicians,
essentially trained in classical style,

135
00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:51.650
did a remake, did a cover of a pop song.

136
00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:58.540
The song was Carly Rae Jepsen's Call Me
Maybe, and was very popular a while back.

137
00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:03.080
You can think whatever you want to
of this song, the classical cover

138
00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:08.020
was done by a traditional chorus in
a Western style symphony orchestra.

139
00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:11.120
And you can think whatever
you want to of that version.

140
00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.280
So let's begin here with the song.

141
00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:17.172
Let's listen to
Carly Rae Jepsen's Call Me Maybe.

142
00:11:17.172 --> 00:11:27.172
[MUSIC]

143
00:11:48.087 --> 00:11:52.077
Yeah, that's probably enough,
it gives you certainly an idea and

144
00:11:52.077 --> 00:11:54.290
likely know the song already.

145
00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:57.400
Okay, so now let's listen to
some of the classical cover.

146
00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.546
[MUSIC]

147
00:11:59.546 --> 00:12:01.962
Very different.

148
00:12:01.962 --> 00:12:02.921
[MUSIC]

149
00:12:02.921 --> 00:12:07.750
Somebody's added slow descending scale.

150
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:15.045
[MUSIC]

151
00:12:15.045 --> 00:12:15.797
Tempo is very different.

152
00:12:15.797 --> 00:12:25.797
[MUSIC]

153
00:13:32.797 --> 00:13:37.466
Okay, well that's probably enough of that,
but it certainly gives you an idea.

154
00:13:37.466 --> 00:13:40.850
Listening to these two versions
cause me to ask myself,

155
00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:42.590
what's good about classical style?

156
00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:45.820
What do classical instrumentalists and
choruses do well?

157
00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:48.240
What makes classical music work?

158
00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:51.870
And what do pop instrumentalists and
pop singers do well?

159
00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:53.920
What makes pop music work?

160
00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:59.150
The song Call Me Maybe has gotten
over half a billion hits on YouTube.

161
00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:02.830
The classical Yale instrumental
version has received two and

162
00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:06.070
a half million,
which is still pretty good.

163
00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:11.290
See which you like better as you
