2
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.200
Today, we begin our investigation of
the history of Western classical music.

3
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.940
As we said in session six,
historians of music.

4
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.190
Sometimes called musicologists,

5
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.810
break the continuum of music history
in eight style periods, Medieval,

6
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.620
Renaissance, Baroque, Classic,Romantic,
Impressionist, Modern and Post Modern.

7
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.230
So, we'll start with the Medieval period.

8
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.458
What were the middle ages?

9
00:00:38.458 --> 00:00:43.420
Well, roughly the period of about 1,000
years from the fall of the Roman empire

10
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.560
about 475 common era, up to the
renaissance and the age of exploration.

11
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.500
We'll say there, arbitrarily,
1450 to 1475 or so.

12
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.210
So, a period of about 1,000 years.

13
00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.840
Where was it centered?

14
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.200
In today, what we call Western Europe.

15
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.140
France, Germany, Italy, Spain, England,

16
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.970
low countries with in many ways France
really being the epicenter of it all.

17
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.865
So, what's new in the Middle Ages?

18
00:01:12.865 --> 00:01:15.360
[LAUGH] Well, not very much.

19
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.060
They're long gone, long passed,
so why do we study it?

20
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.780
Such a remote in many
ways irrelevant past.

21
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.540
Well, visiting the Middle Ages is much
like traveling to a foreign country and

22
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.420
seeing a foreign culture.

23
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.820
Wait a minute you might say, this is
western Europe we are talking about.

24
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.500
How foreign can that be.

25
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.080
Well, it is foreign because of the way
things were done in the Middle Ages.

26
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.400
Religion, education, the arts, music,
it was all very different from today.

27
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.470
How so?

28
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.240
Well, let's just take education.

29
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.150
Almost all of it was in the service of
religion, theology, and almost all of it

30
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.730
involved memory, usually just wrote
memory of conical or prescribed text.

31
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.410
Books were expensive,

32
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.530
many sheep had to lay down their lives
to generate the parchment of a book.

33
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.110
So, generally speaking,
students didn't have books.

34
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.500
They came to class, and

35
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.700
the teacher read out of the book,
and the students repeated.

36
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.850
They even continued this as they
marched around the school yard.

37
00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.930
The teacher read from a book,
the students repeated.

38
00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.930
If, after years of study, the student
had memorized the content of the book.

39
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.440
He was given the book as
a present as he left school.

40
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.820
So, the book wasn't so
much an opportunity to engage education or

41
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.830
an invitation to learn, but
rather a symbol of accomplishment.

42
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.450
So, things were very different back
in the day, back in the Middle Ages.

43
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.735
And they aren't different today,

44
00:02:46.735 --> 00:02:50.580
nowadays we sometimes read
our books on our cellphones.

45
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.580
Well, how was music of
the middle ages different?

46
00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.060
When I was a student, when I was
an undergraduate, I once read a book.

47
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.510
Actually, I hope read more than one book.

48
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.530
What did I do with that book?

49
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.640
Here it is, I have it on the table.

50
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.490
Yan Watsinga,
The Waning of the Middle Ages, and in it,

51
00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.480
the author said one thing that struck
me and has always stuck in my mind.

52
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.470
All art in the Middle Ages
was functional art.

53
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.350
What did Watsinga mean by that?

54
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.360
Well, let's take a look at a picture here.

55
00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.890
A picture is worth a thousand words.

56
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.710
We've got a sculpture from the,
the beautiful cathedral of Chartres.

57
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.780
And we see a group of saints, apostles.

58
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.550
Well, they had a job to do.

59
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.480
Remind the faithful of an exemplary life.

60
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.310
Here, we see an image of Christ.

61
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:52.094
It too, had a job to do, to inspire
the viewer to a greater devotion.

62
00:03:52.094 --> 00:03:56.530
[MUSIC]

63
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:57.923
And even the sounds of the chant.

64
00:03:57.923 --> 00:04:02.521
[MUSIC]

65
00:04:02.521 --> 00:04:04.617
Offered an opportunity for

66
00:04:04.617 --> 00:04:10.800
the reflection, of the message of Christ,
the Christian message.

67
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.330
It was what the music of the church,
the sacred music did.

68
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.060
And there was also of course
music at court, secular music.

69
00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.060
What survives is almost
exclusively dance music.

70
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.590
And even most of the songs with text,
indeed, even such songs.

71
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.250
They were meant to be danced.

72
00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.660
So, courtly music too had a function,
to provide dance music.

73
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.600
What the Middle Ages didn't
have was listening music.

74
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.300
They didn't have concerts
where you went and

75
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.510
listened quietly for purely aesthetic
reasons, pure aesthetic enjoyment.

76
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.225
In the Middle Ages, people either
worshipped, or they sang and danced.

77
00:04:51.225 --> 00:04:53.480
Or they sang as they worked in the fields.

78
00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.440
Music had, as we said, a function.
