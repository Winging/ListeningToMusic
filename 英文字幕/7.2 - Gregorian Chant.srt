00:00:01.206 --> 00:00:11.206
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:20.315 --> 00:00:24.620
What you heard in the background,
is Gregorian Chant.

3
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.038
Gregorian Chant was and
is the music of the Roman Catholic Church.

4
00:00:29.038 --> 00:00:32.910
It was first created in the time
of the Apostles of Christ and

5
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.873
continued to be created,
until the late 16th century, 1500 years.

6
00:00:37.873 --> 00:00:40.373
Well obviously Pope Gregory the Great,

7
00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:46.300
who sat on the throne of Saint Peter from
590 to 605, didn't write all of this.

8
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.420
Indeed he wrote little,
if any chant, but he had

9
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.550
an influential biographer who gave him a
lot more credit than he actually deserved.

10
00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.520
[LAUGH] In a way,
this was typical of the Middle Ages,

11
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.020
to ascribe to a single male authority
figure the works of many individuals,

12
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.490
male and female that transpired over time.

13
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.670
Anyway, we have surviving from
the Middle Ages thousands and

14
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.050
thousands of chants for
the service of the church.

15
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.840
Let's look at a couple more
of these chant manuscripts.

16
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.010
As you can see, this is one-line music,
monophonic music.

17
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.560
Also, all the notes look
pretty much the same.

18
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.710
There are no flags or
stems on them to indicate rhythm,

19
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.940
because generally speaking, there is no
meter and no rhythm in Gregorian chant.

20
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.000
We just float along smoothly, and
more or less, in equal durations.

21
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.940
Well, what's the notation doing here then?

22
00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.812
Well it's simply trying to indicate
the ups and downs of the voice.

23
00:01:50.812 --> 00:01:54.597
So this manuscript that we see
here is of the 13th century.

24
00:01:54.597 --> 00:01:57.978
Now we turn to one of the 14th century,

25
00:01:57.978 --> 00:02:01.865
a salter hymnal from
the Italian city of Rona.

26
00:02:01.865 --> 00:02:06.371
A now a 15th century,
century manuscript and

27
00:02:06.371 --> 00:02:12.692
en tifinagh, inviting the singing
of the magnificat at vespers.

28
00:02:12.692 --> 00:02:20.040
And finally from the extraordinary
piccolomini library in Siena Italy.

29
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.420
A book for the Mass,
an Introit for the Mass.

30
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.290
All right, now let's focus on how
this chant was used in the liturgy.

31
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.970
Liturgy is simply a fancy sounding
word for religious service.

32
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.190
It had two functions.

33
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:43.140
One, to send out the word,
the word of God in rapid fire delivery,

34
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.710
and two, to offer a psychologically
slower kind of chant designed to

35
00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.550
encourage the listener, to reflect
upon Christ and the Christian story.

36
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.630
To present this,
we'll turn to a class video.

37
00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.500
Here you'll see me, dressed as a monk.

38
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.230
Actually, I've lived in monastery
three times in my life.

39
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.000
But only for short durations.

40
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.550
Never more than 10 days.

41
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.240
But I wanted to dress like a monk for
this class and turn out the lights, so

42
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.230
that the students would feel that
they had been transported elsewhere.

43
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.370
To a different time and
place back to the middle ages.

44
00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.793
Accomplished and generally speaking in
the middle ages there was this tendency to

45
00:03:24.793 --> 00:03:25.947
ascribe to a single or

46
00:03:25.947 --> 00:03:29.840
a couple of male authority figures,
a lot more than they actually did.

47
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.870
The point here is the Gregorian chant
was being composed 500 years before

48
00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.280
Gregory set foot on this Earth, and
nearly a 1000 years after that.

49
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.920
What's the purpose of Gregorian chant?

50
00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:43.920
What did it do?

51
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.550
Well, it did two things, one,
it communicated the message of the church,

52
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.420
it allowed for
the transmission of the word of god,

53
00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.740
as they the faithful understood
the word and understood God.

54
00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.520
And it transmitted the theology,
the message of the church.

55
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.340
Chant then, was a medium for
the broadcast, literally,

56
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.210
the broadcast of the word, in a resonant
acoustical environment, such as a stone or

57
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:16.400
stucco church, one can project,
one can impel a text better.

58
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.200
If you sing it rather than just
simply to claim it as usual.

59
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.237
I could say, for

60
00:04:21.237 --> 00:04:26.212
example, now let us read the epistle of
the blessed apostle Paul to the Romans.

61
00:04:26.212 --> 00:04:29.080
But the text projects better if I sing it.

62
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:35.820
[FOREIGN].

63
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.590
In that fashion it goes out better,
and it can reverberate better.

64
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:41.880
Chant used for

65
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:48.170
direct reading, directly communicating
the text was generally syllabic chant.

66
00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:53.330
In syllabic chant,
each syllable has just one note.

67
00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.360
And in syllabic chant, the musical
range tends to be rather narrow.

68
00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.850
The second purpose of chant.

69
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.060
Chant also allowed for

70
00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:08.070
a period of reflection upon
the subject of the preceding reading.

71
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:13.870
A sermon or a passage of scripture would
be followed by a reflective chant.

72
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.470
Time for contemplation.

73
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:24.020
This music for reflection upon a preceding
religious theme, was generally melismatic.

74
00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.690
Now melismatic chant is one in
which there are many notes for

75
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.760
just one syllable of text.

76
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:37.530
And in melismatic chant, the range tends
to be a lot broader, it's more virtuosic.

77
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:42.610
So simple chanting for readings,
that's syllabic chant.

78
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.870
More complex chant for
moments of personal feeling and

79
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.547
reflection, that's melismatic chant.

80
00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:54.880
Let's take a, an example here,
I have my venerable Liber Usualis.

81
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.520
Appear and I'm going to sing
the Hallelujah for Easter Sunday.

82
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.100
At least I'm going to try to sing it.

83
00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.712
And it's an example of a melismatic chant.

84
00:06:03.712 --> 00:06:12.697
And you'll notice one syllable here
is conveyed by probably 30 notes.

85
00:06:12.697 --> 00:06:22.697
[MUSIC]

86
00:06:41.071 --> 00:06:43.610
So that's a melismatic chant.

87
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:49.890
A moment of joyful celebration associated
with the resurrection of Christ.

88
00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:53.840
So that's what chant did and
that's what it does today.

89
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.140
It is firstly a medium for
a projection of sacred texts.

90
00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:02.240
And secondly a vehicle for
spiritual contemplation.
