1
00:00:07.808 --> 00:00:10.165
We'll come back to this monk again later.

2
00:00:10.165 --> 00:00:14.790
But let's talk about where all of this
medieval chant for the church was created.

3
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.130
It was not created at urban churches,
cathedrals, but for rural monasteries.

4
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.330
What you see on the screen here from
the Basque region of Southern France.

5
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.416
Many in the sixth and

6
00:00:29.416 --> 00:00:34.513
seventh centuries were on isolated
coasts particularly in Ireland.

7
00:00:34.513 --> 00:00:38.427
We see the remains of one of them here,
and here are two more slides.

8
00:00:38.427 --> 00:00:41.481
We have an image of Jumieges in France,

9
00:00:41.481 --> 00:00:46.000
a large monastery that
flourished in the tenth century.

10
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.390
And then finally the Abbey, the
Benedictine Abbey Fontenay, where you can

11
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.870
still go and hear the service as sung
there in the church to your right today.

12
00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.630
What did the monks and
nuns do at these monasteries and convents?

13
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.520
They worked and they prayed.

14
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.250
Laboro, oro.

15
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.990
I work, I pray.

16
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.640
They worked to feed their bodies and
they prayed to save their souls.

17
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.880
And they did this on a regular schedule as
set forth by the rule of Saint Benedict.

18
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.550
In a little book written again by
Saint Benedict in the sixth century.

19
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.420
Here's my copy of it,
at least more or less my copy,

20
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.930
the cover is sort of
fallen over through use.

21
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.990
It tells us that the monks and nuns
came together to pray eight times a day.

22
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.890
And, a ninth time to celebrate the mass,
the spiritual high point of the day.

23
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.770
Usually around nine o'clock in the morning
when they took communion with the Lord.

24
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.880
Let me take you to my monastery.

25
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.350
Here you see it on the screen.

26
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.450
I once stayed there many years ago.

27
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.300
Saint Pierre de Solesmes.

28
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.520
South, southwest of Paris.

29
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.090
About 100 miles away from Paris.

30
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.350
Here's the monastery that
you see very imposing.

31
00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.790
I lived here actually in the first floor,
the closest windows.

32
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:10.180
I was allowed, no alarm clock,
no radio and certainly no cell phone.

33
00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.600
But I had to attend all of
the services in the church.

34
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.150
How in the world did I wake up?

35
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.290
Well, the ringing of the bells.

36
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.790
Actually the french word for bell,
cloche, equals our or gives us our clock.

37
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.720
And the Latin horo, english for hour.

38
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.660
So the bells called me to make
my way over to the church.

39
00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.800
Every guest who lives in the monastery
has to attend a services of the monks

40
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.380
in their church.

41
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.520
When I worked I went into the library
to study Gregorian chant and

42
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.990
I took my meals here in the refectory, the
dining hall no talking no conversation.

43
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.997
The Abby sits at one end and
someone reads the daily newspaper of

44
00:02:53.997 --> 00:02:57.325
the Roman Catholic Church
L'Osservatore Romano,

45
00:02:57.325 --> 00:03:00.285
The Roman Observer
published by The Vatican.

46
00:03:02.641 --> 00:03:09.061
So as you sense, it was a very different
world, an entirely spiritual world.

47
00:03:09.061 --> 00:03:14.140
Now there were also convents, of course,
where nuns lived and slept and worshiped.

48
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.570
Here we see the very large convent at
Fontevraud in Loire Valley in France.

49
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.100
In this church Richard the Lionheart and
Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine are buried.

50
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.860
This is no longer actually
a functioning church.

51
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.210
Here you see the cloister.

52
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.990
It's a cultural center for
the region of Tours, France.

53
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.400
But it was huge in its day.

54
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.510
That nonetheless gives you a sense
of the size of this content here.

55
00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.900
All of these nuns sleeping
in this same room.

56
00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.410
Perhaps the most famous nun
of the middle ages, and

57
00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.500
the most famous female creator of
Gregorian chant, was Hildegard of Bingen,

58
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.500
who lived in Germany on the banks of
the Rhine River during the 12th century.

59
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.760
To meet Hildegard,
let's go back to the classroom and

60
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.810
reconnect with that strange
looking Benedictine Book.

61
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.690
One spiritual leader
within the community of

62
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.330
Benedictine convents was
Hildegard of Bingen.

63
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.090
Hildegard lived in the 12th century.

64
00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.640
She came from the area of Bingen on the
west bank of the Rhine river in Germany.

65
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.190
She grew up in a Benedictine convent.

66
00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.950
Here is the ruins of that
Benedictine convent and

67
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:34.670
then she went on ultimately to found her
own convent and these are the ruins,

68
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:41.350
or a 17th century drawing of that
convent which is now also in ruins.

69
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.880
Hildegard was a polymath.

70
00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.740
She could do many things.

71
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.340
She wrote on church administration,
on botany,

72
00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.190
on pharmacology, on medicine and on music.

73
00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:57.690
Indeed, because of this diversity, we can,
I think, fairly say that the first

74
00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.730
renaissance man,
in actuality was a medieval woman.

75
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.630
Hildegard of Bingen.

76
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.620
Popes and Bishops sought her advice,
in part because she was a visionary.

77
00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.210
She had visions associated
with the Christian story.

78
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.440
Hildegard also wrote Gregorian chant.

79
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.670
So, let's look at some slides of
Hildegard, she was famous in her day.

80
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:25.110
Here we have a manuscript put together in
northern Italy about 20 years after her

81
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.500
death with the representation of
Hildegard up there on the top left.

82
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.410
Next slide takes us to
a blow up of this and

83
00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:38.450
we see the representation of
Hildegard having a celestial vision.

84
00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.250
That's why the wavy lines
going up from her head.

85
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.932
She's receiving the Holy Spirit.

86
00:05:43.932 --> 00:05:47.870
She is copying down what she

87
00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.550
perceives, not on a notebook computer,

88
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.700
but on a wax tablet with a large
stylus in her right hand.

89
00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.760
Her assistant, the one male allowed
in this community for the sacraments,

90
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.910
her assistant, Volmar,
peeks in astonished at what he is seeing.
