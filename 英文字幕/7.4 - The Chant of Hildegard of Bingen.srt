[MUSIC]

2
00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:17.801
All right.

3
00:00:17.801 --> 00:00:20.950
Let's have a listen now
to a chant of Hildegard.

4
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.230
Lillegard wrote about eighty of them.

5
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.768
Here is a page from a manuscript in
Belgium that preserves just one them.

6
00:00:27.768 --> 00:00:30.340
A sample page, and

7
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.360
here is a blow up of that same page so
that can see it a little more clearly.

8
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:37.456
Just enlarged.

00:00:37.456 --> 00:00:38.164
[MUSIC]

10
00:00:38.164 --> 00:00:41.130
Now, a modern edition of
the chant by Hildegard,

11
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.180
made off of that manuscript, by myself.

12
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.550
Hildegard's music is very tonal.

13
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.840
It ends each phrase on
either the dominant pitch or

14
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.310
the tonic pitch,
as you can see in the red notes.

15
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.650
And I'll highlight them, here.

16
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.760
Here's one dominant note, here's another
dominant note, here's a tonic note,

17
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.020
a dominant note, dominant note,
and a final tonic note.

18
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.630
Most important,
Hildegard's text is wildly vivid.

19
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.730
She wrote not only the music,
but the text as well.

20
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.040
And this is just typical of hers.

21
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.391
Let me translate it for you.

22
00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:24.750
A redness of blood that
flowed down from the heaven.

23
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.700
You are the flower that the wintry
breath of the serpent never wounded.

24
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.230
Let's talk about the setting of this text.

25
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.770
Some of it is syllabic.

26
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.150
Each syllable of text has only one or
two pitches.

27
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.790
Sometimes it is melismatic.

28
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.020
One syllable is assigned many pitches.

29
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.360
Not for example, fluisti here.

30
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.010
Many many pitches for that one word.

31
00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:00.220
And that's an interesting case because
it's, the word means and you flowed, and

32
00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.550
indeed the music seems to flow
rapidly down from high to low.

33
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:10.180
That's actually very unusual with chant
and with almost with all medieval music.

34
00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.800
Text and music operate independently.

35
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.080
Music is abstract with regard to the text.

36
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.830
It carries, but it does not reinforce it.

37
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.990
The recording that you will hear is
one that I created some years back

38
00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.440
with three professional women singers.

39
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.560
I call them the Hildegard singers.

40
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.002
I'll follow along as they sing.

41
00:02:31.002 --> 00:02:41.002
[MUSIC]

42
00:02:59.085 --> 00:03:09.085
Very

43
00:03:12.467 --> 00:03:22.467
beautiful.

44
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.018
To sum up,

45
00:03:50.018 --> 00:03:56.080
Gregorian chant is monophonic, one line,
music of the Roman Catholic church.

46
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.751
Sung unaccompanied, in Latin,
in the Middle Ages, and

47
00:03:59.751 --> 00:04:02.733
down to the present day
in some monasteries and

48
00:04:02.733 --> 00:04:07.103
some specially designated churches
that honor the old Latin Mass.

49
00:04:07.103 --> 00:04:10.680
It has no accompaniment,
no meter, and no rhythm.

50
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.620
It generally is music for contemplation.

51
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.810
It is spiritually entombed,
it is transcendental music,

52
00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.999
music that takes your mind elsewhere,
as Hildegard says,

53
00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:26.884
carries you away, as it did her,
like a feather on the breath of God.
