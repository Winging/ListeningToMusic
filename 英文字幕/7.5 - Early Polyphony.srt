[MUSIC]

2
00:00:19.256 --> 00:00:23.720
The music you just heard is another
recording I created some years back.

3
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.380
It involves two singers,
melody plus accompaniment.

4
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.100
So it's an example of polyphony?

5
00:00:30.105 --> 00:00:34.850
You'll remember from our session six,
that there are three kinds of textures,

6
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.770
three primary textures in music.

7
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.800
And they are, well yes, monophonic,
homophonic, and polyphonic.

8
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.190
Chant was monophonic in texture.

9
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.930
But to make the church services more
splendid on high feast days of the year,

10
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.250
enterprising churchmen, musicians,

11
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.310
began to add additional voices to
the chant to make a more splendid sound.

12
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.040
Thereby creating polyphony.

13
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.010
At first this polyphony
was just improvised.

14
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.790
Then they began to write it down.

15
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.490
Let's see what this early
polyphony looked like.

16
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.300
Here we see a manuscript form
the ninth century, top and bottom.

17
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.500
Well, on top we have a three voice chant.

18
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.530
And as you can see here, the voices are
operating at the interval of a fifth and

19
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.946
the interval of an octave
moving along all in lockstep.

20
00:01:28.946 --> 00:01:35.360
Below, we have two voices,
two voices moving in counterpoint.

21
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.050
Usually when one goes up,
the other goes down.

22
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.920
And again, mostly at the same time.

23
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.290
In both cases, the funny signs over here,
actually to the left,

24
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.000
the funny signs indicate pitches and
pitch relationships.

25
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.650
Now, a slide from Southern France
in the 12th Century.

26
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.935
The chant is actually on
the bottom line here see,

27
00:01:59.935 --> 00:02:03.990
[FOREIGN],
on the bottom line.

28
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.950
Working with the singers here,
we know what the pitches are.

29
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.690
We know what they're supposed to be.

30
00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.980
But what we didn't know was how long
each of these pitches should be held.

31
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.500
We were just winging it
with regard to rhythm.

32
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.260
What we tried to do was make
good vertical consonances.

33
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.980
So let's listen to a bit of
this recording that resulted.

34
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.982
We don't have time for all of it, so we're
going to hear just a bit of the beginning,

35
00:02:31.982 --> 00:02:34.175
and then we'll skip toward the end.

36
00:02:34.175 --> 00:02:36.643
Okay?

37
00:02:36.643 --> 00:02:46.643
[MUSIC]

38
00:03:39.017 --> 00:03:43.821
Creating a recording like this is
possible, if you have only two parts,

39
00:03:43.821 --> 00:03:44.950
two voices.

40
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.511
But if you want three or four or

41
00:03:46.511 --> 00:03:50.870
five parts, then the absence of
rhythmic specificity becomes a problem.

42
00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.940
Let's see how they solved it.

43
00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.020
Well, they did so by adding stems
on to the notes and note heads.

44
00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.759
And eventually by creating note
heads of different shapes.

45
00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.140
Here we see in our next slide,
down at the bottom, some music that looks

46
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.698
disturbingly organized,
because it has rhythmic component to it.

47
00:04:11.698 --> 00:04:21.250
And these patterns began to take more and
more of a definitive shape.

48
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.190
As you can see by this slide,
one that I've created here,

49
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:30.120
you can see that there are stems beginning
to develop into notational symbols,

50
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.480
stems and note heads of different shapes.

51
00:04:34.538 --> 00:04:38.700
And then we see here,
in this mid 13th century motet,

52
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.420
a great deal of organization.

53
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.010
This development,
the capacity to specify and

54
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.040
control rhythm in a precise way,
was hugely important.

55
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.060
What are the two axes of music?

56
00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.850
Well, pitch and duration.

57
00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.500
Pitch notation had existed for
centuries, since the 9th century.

58
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.230
But rhythmic notation only came into being
in the late 12th century, 300 years later.

59
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.430
And it was a game changer.

60
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.330
Up to that point, music unfolded through
memory and through improvisation.

61
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.120
Musicians could remember a chant,
and someone could come along and

62
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.150
improvise another voice against it.

63
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.196
But now, if you wanted big pieces of
polyphony, let's say with three, four,

64
00:05:23.196 --> 00:05:26.100
or five voices, it got complicated and

65
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.210
you had to be able to
determine things in advance.

66
00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.340
And you had to do this through
prescriptive notation.

67
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.700
Thus, in the West,
we moved from performance and

68
00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.270
improvisation, to a priori composition.

69
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.740
The creator, the artist,

70
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.310
began to loom large, and the importance
of the performer diminished.

71
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.300
The creator was now the great architect.

72
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.600
The performer, just the carpenter.

73
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.630
What the architect created,
what the composer wrote down,

74
00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.730
was a finite composition.

75
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.370
So in this period in Western European
history, in the High and

76
00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.990
Late Middle Ages, we have the advent of
the composer of polyphony as we know it,

77
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.040
and we had the work of art as we know it.

78
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.900
And because that work of art can be
written down in almost all of its

79
00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.810
specifics, it can not only be
performed at a later time, but

80
00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.390
it can be also be analyzed and studied.

81
00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:28.530
Musical analysis is now possible.

82
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:35.350
This specifying rhythm as well as pitch
was part of the change to quantification

83
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:41.350
in the West, a shift to specific
measurement of a lot of things.

84
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.938
Organ pipes on a large scale,
mechanical clocks,

85
00:06:44.938 --> 00:06:49.290
the shift from Roman to Arabic numerals,

86
00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:52.890
this all happens in the West here
in the High and Late Middle Ages.

87
00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:58.270
Actually, musical notation,
with its vertical axis for pitch and

88
00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:03.800
its horizontal axis for duration,
was the West's first written graph.

89
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.500
Where did this happen?

90
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.080
In France, specifically in Paris and

91
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.259
other cathedral cities such as Reims.
