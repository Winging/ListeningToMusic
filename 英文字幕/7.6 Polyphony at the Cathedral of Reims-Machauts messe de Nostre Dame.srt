[MUSIC]

2
00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:17.056
In this segment we will see of the
creation of of the means to control not

3
00:00:17.056 --> 00:00:18.058
only pitch but

4
00:00:18.058 --> 00:00:22.753
also rhythm allowed composers to
create long and complex pieces.

5
00:00:22.753 --> 00:00:28.121
And to do this, we'll take a virtual
trip to France, first to Paris and

6
00:00:28.121 --> 00:00:34.129
then a hundred miles out to the east in
the Champagne region to the city of Reims.

7
00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:39.171
Here you see, of course, the facade
of the famous Notre Dame of Paris.

8
00:00:40.921 --> 00:00:43.462
Let's take a look now, inside.

9
00:00:43.462 --> 00:00:45.170
Here we see two images.

10
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.735
On the left the Choir of Notre Dame
as it currently exists and

11
00:00:49.735 --> 00:00:54.482
on the right as it existed in
the Middle Ages with the stalls for

12
00:00:54.482 --> 00:00:59.047
the clergy on either side in
this large root screen which was

13
00:00:59.047 --> 00:01:03.100
taken down during the revolution,
There present.

14
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.462
The singers would actually come
out in the middle of the choir.

15
00:01:06.462 --> 00:01:10.059
Now here's a manuscript
of the type of music,

16
00:01:10.059 --> 00:01:14.128
actually is the music they were singing.

17
00:01:14.128 --> 00:01:16.004
A four part composition.

18
00:01:16.004 --> 00:01:19.280
Let me see if I can grab
the tenor part here.

19
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.340
Here is that chant here,
there's the first note.

20
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.270
That's the second note.

21
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.672
You can see the tenor holding out there.

22
00:01:24.672 --> 00:01:27.046
We'll talk a little bit
more about that later.

23
00:01:27.046 --> 00:01:30.796
Okay, now let's go onto the city of Reims.

24
00:01:30.796 --> 00:01:34.505
Here we see it as it looked
in the 18th century.

25
00:01:34.505 --> 00:01:40.423
And going back to this 17th century image,
we'll see how Reims towered over the town.

26
00:01:40.423 --> 00:01:42.140
Here is the cathedral here.

27
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.854
We're gonna focus on this street back
up here because one of the clergy men,

28
00:01:46.854 --> 00:01:49.297
name, Gilliam Dimesho, lived here.

29
00:01:49.297 --> 00:01:54.962
And we're now going to go to the interior
of Reims as it currently looks today.

30
00:01:54.962 --> 00:02:00.379
The very beautiful and
very unusual west facade of Reims.

31
00:02:00.379 --> 00:02:04.890
And now the interior of Reims as it
looked during the Middle Ages in

32
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.005
a drawing by the architectural
historian Patrick Denois.

33
00:02:09.005 --> 00:02:13.820
And you can see here, the stalls for
the clergy on either side.

34
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.942
Actually this is a representation of
the coronation of the king of France,

35
00:02:18.942 --> 00:02:22.210
which occurred here at
the Cathedral of Reims.

36
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.855
And note here in the center
the large lectern.

37
00:02:24.855 --> 00:02:31.940
Thatâ€™s where the musicians would go when
chant and polyphony was to be performed.

38
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.523
And here is our composer that
we will be discussing today,

39
00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:41.490
churchman Guillaume de Machaut In
a 14th century likeness.

40
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.171
Actually, the earliest likeness
that we have of a western composer.

41
00:02:48.171 --> 00:02:55.510
And we're gonna focus now on a Mass
by Machaut, Our Lady Mass of Machaut.

42
00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.720
But let's see what's first
involved in a musical Mass.

43
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.120
The mass, in terms of its musical parts,
is divided into two types.

44
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.440
The proper of the mass,
which you see listed on the left, and

45
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.650
the ordinary of the mass which
you see listed on the right.

46
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.380
The proper is sung every day.

47
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.046
It's proper to that day.

48
00:03:15.046 --> 00:03:18.718
On the Feast of St, John the Baptist for
example, the introit,

49
00:03:18.718 --> 00:03:23.002
the opening chant, might begin,
Oh wonderful John who baptized Christ,

50
00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:24.990
or whatever it might happen to be.

51
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:30.781
But, if we focus on the left side, we have
just those chants that are sung everyday,

52
00:03:30.781 --> 00:03:35.348
and we can extract those and
put them here in a list that runs Kyrie,

53
00:03:35.348 --> 00:03:38.220
Gloria, Credo, Sanctus and Agnus Dei.

54
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.910
So those are the chants of
the Ordinary of the Mass.

55
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.010
Now let's look at the tenor.

56
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.670
How did Machaut go about
constructing this?

57
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.920
Well, he took a tenor voice, and
he rhythmicized it as you can see here.

58
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:53.837
Originally, this went.

59
00:03:53.837 --> 00:04:00.004
[MUSIC]

60
00:04:00.004 --> 00:04:00.962
And so on.

61
00:04:00.962 --> 00:04:03.337
But he rhythmicized it, as I said, into

62
00:04:03.337 --> 00:04:11.922
[MUSIC]

63
00:04:11.922 --> 00:04:13.796
And so on.

64
00:04:13.796 --> 00:04:17.003
And then he wrote surrounding music for
it.

65
00:04:17.003 --> 00:04:21.228
Let's take a look at this next slide
where he have the four parts of this,

66
00:04:21.228 --> 00:04:23.880
the beginning and
ending of the first Kyrie.

67
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.570
As you can see he has written a bass line,
an alto line in the superius.

68
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.292
Actually originally they
were called the tenor,

69
00:04:31.292 --> 00:04:33.310
which held out the long notes there.

70
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.270
Then we had the contra tenor bassos.

71
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.712
Then we had the contra tenor altus.

72
00:04:37.712 --> 00:04:40.172
And from that we get bass and alto.

73
00:04:40.172 --> 00:04:42.395
If you've ever wondered why
the alto is actually the high,

74
00:04:42.395 --> 00:04:43.910
it's actually lower than the soprano.

75
00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.200
It's because it was originally
reckoned against the tenor.

76
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.296
So we have tenor, bass,
alto, and then soprano.

77
00:04:50.296 --> 00:04:53.504
And they were added roughly in that order.

78
00:04:53.504 --> 00:04:57.920
And here we have a full
score of that Kyrie.

79
00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.260
You can see as it plays out
through several measures.

80
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.820
And here now, we actually have
Machaut's original manuscript.

81
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.285
We can't be sure that this was in his
hand, that this is his musical hand, but

82
00:05:10.285 --> 00:05:13.530
this is from the 14th century,
all four parts there.

83
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.041
So we're going to listen to this,
and if all goes well,

84
00:05:17.041 --> 00:05:21.920
we'll follow along with the cursor on
the screen here, the superious part.

85
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.640
The top part up here.

86
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.797
So let's see if we can get it going and
we'll follow along.

87
00:05:27.797 --> 00:05:37.797
[MUSIC]

88
00:06:25.087 --> 00:06:26.254
Good, it worked.

89
00:06:26.254 --> 00:06:32.046
So let's go back to that slide that we
saw of the interior of the cathedral.

90
00:06:32.046 --> 00:06:37.207
In his will Machaut stipulated that
he wanted this mass that he composed,

91
00:06:37.207 --> 00:06:42.282
in honor of the virgin to be sung in
his memory, right here at this alter,

92
00:06:42.282 --> 00:06:45.546
in the entrance of the choir
on the south side.

93
00:06:45.546 --> 00:06:48.729
This altar to the Virgin,
statute of the Virgin, and

94
00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:53.209
here it was sung every Saturday in
perpetuity, or at least for centuries.

95
00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.350
So, what's the point?

96
00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:59.010
What's the take away here
with the Machaut Mass?

97
00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:00.171
Well, several things.

98
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:06.150
First, we're very close to seeing the
labeling of voice parts that we know them.

99
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:10.190
This idea of soprano,
alto, tenor and bass.

100
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:15.680
Also, we have a large split in terms
of the range between soprano and bass.

101
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.649
Greater seniority, it means it sounds
goods and we have a long piece,

102
00:07:20.649 --> 00:07:22.260
20 to 25 minutes.

103
00:07:23.675 --> 00:07:28.295
Because what he has done is to bind
them all together by using a common

104
00:07:28.295 --> 00:07:29.685
motive or theme.

105
00:07:29.685 --> 00:07:32.296
One melody that sounds
throughout all five movements.

106
00:07:32.296 --> 00:07:36.046
[MUSIC]

107
00:07:36.046 --> 00:07:37.297
That's the binding.

108
00:07:37.297 --> 00:07:38.215
The adhesive there.

109
00:07:39.245 --> 00:07:43.610
Most important we have
the concept of a mass.

110
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:47.758
Other composers, later composers,
Palestrina, Bach, Mozart, Beethoven,

111
00:07:47.758 --> 00:07:49.730
Brookners, Travinski.

112
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:55.422
They composed in Palifini, the five
sections of the ordinary of the mass.

113
00:07:55.422 --> 00:07:59.004
As we've said, Kyrie, Gloria,
Credo Sanctus, and Agnus Dei.

114
00:07:59.004 --> 00:08:03.462
With his mass Machaut
had set the standard.
