[MUSIC]

2
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.778
>> So far, our investigation of music
during the Middle Ages has centered on

3
00:00:18.778 --> 00:00:19.887
religious music.

4
00:00:19.887 --> 00:00:21.820
Music of the Roman Catholic Church.

5
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.100
Then the only Christian
religion in the European west.

6
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.820
But, there was also secular music,
non-religious music, and for

7
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.250
that, there was popular secular music.

8
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.810
Well what was this pop music like?

9
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.530
We really have no idea.

10
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.400
Or at least little idea, why?

11
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.720
Because the people who created
the pop music were illiterate,

12
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.290
couldn't read or write.

13
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.280
In the middle ages,

14
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.170
almost everyone was illiterate,
the only people who were literate.

15
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.860
Who could write things down,
well they were the clergy, and

16
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.140
they tended to write down religious music.

17
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:06.540
So pop musicians made, but
had no capacity to record their music.

18
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.890
And thus,
almost all of it has disappeared.

19
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.480
But, some secular, non-religious music,
does survive from the aristocratic courts.

20
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.574
This music was created by the troubadours
and trouvÃ¨res, and sometimes by the same

21
00:01:20.574 --> 00:01:25.378
priests who were composing sacred music
for the church, but also appearing in

22
00:01:25.378 --> 00:01:29.914
court from time to time, and
in that context, wrote down secular music.

23
00:01:29.914 --> 00:01:33.814
Michaud, for example, worked at the court
of several kings around Europe.

24
00:01:33.814 --> 00:01:36.858
The King of Bohemia,
the King of [INAUDIBLE] and

25
00:01:36.858 --> 00:01:40.223
The King of France in
the course of his long career.

26
00:01:40.223 --> 00:01:46.020
So let's look now at the secular song and
dance centered at the courts.

27
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.362
And to do this, we have to call on
a true expert, our guest for the day.

28
00:01:53.362 --> 00:01:57.200
So welcome again to another segment
of Introduction to Classical Music.

29
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.470
I'm delighted to have with us today,
my good friend and

30
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.050
colleague here at Yale, Grant Herreid.

31
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.210
Grant not only teaches music at Yale,

32
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.390
he is a world-renowned professional
early music performance specialist.

33
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.962
And indeed, Grant just got off
an airplane a day or so ago.

34
00:02:14.962 --> 00:02:16.912
Now, where were you, Austria,
something like that?

35
00:02:16.912 --> 00:02:21.719
>> I was in Austria, in Melk, and in
another little town in a little mini tour.

36
00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:26.375
>> So he works out of New Haven, he also
works as many professional musicians do

37
00:02:26.375 --> 00:02:30.230
these days, out of New York City and
travels around the world,

38
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.796
playing in a professional group
called Pifero, and one or

39
00:02:33.796 --> 00:02:37.036
two others that we don't
have time to go into today.

40
00:02:37.036 --> 00:02:40.997
But what we're gonna do is take you
through some of these instruments

41
00:02:40.997 --> 00:02:44.630
that were the primary media of
performance in the Middle Ages.

42
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.570
And we're going to look at some
slides here, and Grant and

43
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.604
I are going to comment on those slides,
and you will be seeing those slides too.

44
00:02:51.604 --> 00:02:56.238
I showed this to Grant a couple of moments
ago, and this is entirely unscripted and

45
00:02:56.238 --> 00:02:59.140
unrehearsed, and
he recognized it immediately.

46
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.685
So, what is this?

47
00:03:00.685 --> 00:03:03.284
>> It's from the, a large work in Sienna,

48
00:03:03.284 --> 00:03:08.115
called the effects of good government,
from the 14th century, right?

49
00:03:08.115 --> 00:03:09.460
>> Yeah.

50
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.498
I remember I actually took this photo,

51
00:03:11.498 --> 00:03:16.030
I remember being way up kind of high on a
wall, it occupied an entire wall of that.

52
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.182
And in terms of looking at this,

53
00:03:18.182 --> 00:03:22.340
what do you see by way of
performance activity here?

54
00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:30.370
>> It's one of two examples in iconography
of, at least, of ladies dancing.

55
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.500
And you can see here, the dancers
doing some sort of a circle dance,

56
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.790
which would have been called a Carole,

57
00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.150
to the accompaniment of one
of the ladies playing a drum.

58
00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.160
And since her mouth is open,
it is possible that she is also singing.

59
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.391
So a dance song.

60
00:03:46.391 --> 00:03:51.013
>> Yeah, so the whole idea of singing,
and our English word Carol,

61
00:03:51.013 --> 00:03:54.726
is probably related to this,
in one way or another.

62
00:03:54.726 --> 00:03:56.030
Let's look at another one.

63
00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.175
This particular image comes from France.

64
00:03:59.175 --> 00:04:02.755
That much I know for sure, 14th
century in the bibliotheque le somail,

65
00:04:02.755 --> 00:04:05.495
in the collection Franc Francais there.

66
00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:11.238
And we have a group of figures to
the right, and then another dance there,

67
00:04:11.238 --> 00:04:15.142
but once again,
most likely this was being sung.

68
00:04:15.142 --> 00:04:19.623
The text [FOREIGN].

69
00:04:19.623 --> 00:04:20.668
>> Oh, you can read that.

70
00:04:20.668 --> 00:04:21.248
>> Yes.

71
00:04:21.248 --> 00:04:22.556
>> You're a better man that I.

72
00:04:22.556 --> 00:04:27.265
>> [FOREIGN] And in fact,
this is from his [FOREIGN],

73
00:04:27.265 --> 00:04:34.108
at a moment where the poet,
Michaud himself, encounters his lady.

74
00:04:34.108 --> 00:04:36.871
Much younger than himself,
dancing with her friends.

75
00:04:36.871 --> 00:04:38.282
And it says clearly in the text,

76
00:04:38.282 --> 00:04:40.702
that they're dancing without
musical instruments.

77
00:04:40.702 --> 00:04:41.560
>> Oh, really?

78
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.260
>> And they're providing all the music
themselves with their voices.

79
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.410
And I think at one point,
she raises her little finger and

80
00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.560
beckons him to join the group.

81
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.422
And it's his turn to sing, and so
he sings this song [CROSSTALK].

82
00:04:53.422 --> 00:04:55.380
>> Fascinating.

83
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.944
Well, let's look at, now,

84
00:04:56.944 --> 00:05:00.461
you mentioned that this one would
have been danced to simply song.

85
00:05:00.461 --> 00:05:02.550
But people sing and
dance, obviously, today.

86
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.740
Let's look at another image here.

87
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.660
And on the right side of the screen,

88
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.700
we actually have one of
these dance manuscripts.

89
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.683
This again from the collection
at the Biblioteca Nacional.

90
00:05:13.683 --> 00:05:19.204
And then on the left, more importantly,
if we've had the full image here,

91
00:05:19.204 --> 00:05:24.230
we would have dancers and
the instrument that is accompanying here.

92
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.350
So tell us, Grant,
about this particular instrument please.

93
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:29.870
>> This is known as the vielle.

94
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.760
And it is the, sort of, the work horse
of the medieval minstrel we feel.

95
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.940
Probably one of the main instruments
to accompany both Troubadour singing,

96
00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.790
to accompany the Trouvere poetry in parts.

97
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.710
And also probably to provide dance music.

98
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.945
>> Yeah, so it might be going a bit
too far, but in an odd sort of way,

99
00:05:52.945 --> 00:05:56.795
almost etymologically, or
at least organographically,

100
00:05:56.795 --> 00:06:00.415
it's related to the guitar,
in some odd kinds of ways.

101
00:06:00.415 --> 00:06:04.331
Distantly, and we'll get into that as we
go through some of the Vielles in the 15th

102
00:06:04.331 --> 00:06:05.337
and 16th century.

103
00:06:05.337 --> 00:06:08.727
But it was almost a factotum.

104
00:06:08.727 --> 00:06:11.675
You could a lot of things with
this particular instrument.

105
00:06:11.675 --> 00:06:12.980
Let's look at some other slides.

106
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.290
I'm gonna ask Grant to comment
on this one in particular,

107
00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:23.610
because here we have a different kind of
position for the instrument, the Vielle.

108
00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.540
>> It's often hard to tell how large
an instrument is, from iconography.

109
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.680
Often the painters seem to take
liberties with the dimensions of things.

110
00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.710
But we know from practical experience,
that a smaller Vielle,

111
00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:41.870
you can play up on your arm,
like we play the violin.

112
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:46.302
The larger ones, you'd have to play
down more like a cello or something, so

113
00:06:46.302 --> 00:06:50.610
that seems to be what this fellow
is doing, with his crossed leg.

114
00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:51.273
>> Yeah.

115
00:06:51.273 --> 00:06:55.521
So again,
this instrument is called the Vielle,

116
00:06:55.521 --> 00:06:59.163
spelled V-I-E-L-L-E, vielle, and

117
00:06:59.163 --> 00:07:04.438
here is another representation
from Italy around 1400.

118
00:07:04.438 --> 00:07:07.712
Maybe not too much we can say about that.

119
00:07:07.712 --> 00:07:13.075
Any comments that you wanna add there,
Grant?

120
00:07:13.075 --> 00:07:16.097
>> This one is one that seems
to have a [INAUDIBLE] string,

121
00:07:16.097 --> 00:07:18.323
a string that's off the fingerboard.

122
00:07:18.323 --> 00:07:24.001
So just a plain drone that gives us
a clue as to the sort of droney types

123
00:07:24.001 --> 00:07:29.500
of accompaniment that these early
fiddle players may have used.

124
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.810
>> And I think this may be the last one of
these that we're going to take a look at.

125
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:33.795
It's a lot later,

126
00:07:33.795 --> 00:07:37.437
it comes from the times of Raphael
in Rome in the early 16th century.

127
00:07:37.437 --> 00:07:40.890
But it's a particularly
beautiful example of a Vielle.

128
00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:43.210
And what do you see here?

129
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:44.740
What strikes you about this?

130
00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.754
>> And this is a depiction of
Apollo playing the lyre, and

131
00:07:48.754 --> 00:07:54.077
in the early Renaissance, the lira
da braccio, the lyre that you played

132
00:07:54.077 --> 00:07:59.332
on your arm like that, was the main
representation of Apollo's lyre.

133
00:07:59.332 --> 00:08:04.032
And you can see that it has seven pegs,
and therefore seven strings,

134
00:08:04.032 --> 00:08:08.167
and that's also an imitation
of the ancient lyre of Apollo,

135
00:08:08.167 --> 00:08:11.591
which was supposed to have
seven strings as well.

136
00:08:11.591 --> 00:08:12.543
>> Yeah.

137
00:08:12.543 --> 00:08:16.594
Okay well those are some
images of the principle

138
00:08:16.594 --> 00:08:21.158
string instrument of the Middles Ages,
the Vielle.

139
00:08:21.158 --> 00:08:27.891
We're now going to back and take a look
at some other dance representations.

140
00:08:27.891 --> 00:08:31.797
But before we do that, we want to actually
hear the sound of the Vielle, and

141
00:08:31.797 --> 00:08:36.520
I think Grant's going to be able to
demonstrate this, on his own instrument.

142
00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.780
>> This is a copy

143
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:42.590
that looks very much like one of
the depictions that we just showed.

144
00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:46.529
And the main way that they played it seems
to have been up on the arm like this.

145
00:08:46.529 --> 00:08:53.588
[MUSIC]

146
00:08:53.588 --> 00:08:59.230
So, but as the other fella had it on his
leg, you could also play it in this style.

147
00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:05.638
[MUSIC]

148
00:09:05.638 --> 00:09:06.242
>> Cool.

149
00:09:06.242 --> 00:09:11.165
So that's the way it sounded in the Middle
Ages, although this is a reproduction.

150
00:09:11.165 --> 00:09:13.928
Right?
This does not come from the 14th Century.

151
00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:16.876
>> No, there are no Vielles from that.

152
00:09:16.876 --> 00:09:20.880
I think the earliest one that anyone plays
is actually played by Jordi Savall, and

153
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.867
it comes from the early 16th Century.

154
00:09:22.867 --> 00:09:26.380
>> I see, yeah,
the Spanish early music specialist.

155
00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:26.930
Well, let's go on.

156
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:30.070
We're gonna look at some more slides now,
and you're going to join us.

157
00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:34.570
Here is one from England, as you can see,
and we want to focus now on

158
00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:39.440
what we do see here accompanying
instruments, clearly, a bagpipe, and

159
00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:45.800
some [INSUDIBE] here,
and then our next slide.

160
00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.710
Thoughts about this, Grant?

161
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:54.960
>> The common, sort of dance band of
the late 14th or early 15th century or

162
00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.418
throughout the 15th century, in fact,
was the alte capello, or the loud band.

163
00:09:59.418 --> 00:10:05.850
Comprised of shams,
the early sort of oboe type instruments,

164
00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:10.900
oboe and english horn, and often a brass
instrument, either a slides trumpet or

165
00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:15.240
an early trombone, which was called
Sackbut, in England and France.

166
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:20.702
>> So we're gonna get to a representation
of that little bit later on.

167
00:10:20.702 --> 00:10:22.397
Let's look at a manuscript.

168
00:10:22.397 --> 00:10:24.707
It's not too much that
we have to say about,

169
00:10:24.707 --> 00:10:28.900
we're going back to that same manuscript
of some of this medieval dance music.

170
00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:32.110
This dates from the 14th century.

171
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:38.250
And, one can transcribe this material,

172
00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:41.610
if we look carefully, we could actually
point at the little stems going up and

173
00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:44.290
down, and
they're the precursors of the stems and

174
00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:49.320
flags that we have on notational symbols
today, what we call notes today.

175
00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:54.020
And then we can take this early manuscript
here, and as my friend, Tim McGee,

176
00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:59.050
who teaches at the University of Toronto,
has done and edited in modern notation.

177
00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:03.535
So over to the left, you see a facsimile
of the original notation, and I could take

178
00:11:03.535 --> 00:11:07.955
you through that with regard to semibreves
and breves and that kind of thing, but

179
00:11:07.955 --> 00:11:11.273
we end up with quarter notes and
eighth notes and half notes.

180
00:11:11.273 --> 00:11:18.360
So, now, we're going to hear the
instrument that was foregrounded there,

181
00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:25.150
this double reed instrument called
the Shewm, S-H-E-W-M, Shewm.

182
00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:27.250
So, Grant, what do we have here?

183
00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:28.214
What's this thing?

184
00:11:28.214 --> 00:11:30.838
>> This is what we call the Alto size.

185
00:11:30.838 --> 00:11:33.578
This again is a modern reproduction.

186
00:11:33.578 --> 00:11:36.688
We don't really know what
kind of reeds they played on,

187
00:11:36.688 --> 00:11:38.617
since none of the reeds survived.

188
00:11:38.617 --> 00:11:43.361
But whole collections of different sizes
of Shawms do survive from the early

189
00:11:43.361 --> 00:11:44.332
renaissance.

190
00:11:44.332 --> 00:11:46.770
And this is modeled on one of those.

191
00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:51.502
It's also called the Bombard, because
it resembled a type of early cannon.

192
00:11:51.502 --> 00:11:54.880
[SOUND]
>> [LAUGH] It sounds like one, too.

193
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.480
So are you gonna play it?

194
00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.615
>> This is a bit of that.

195
00:11:58.615 --> 00:12:02.287
[CROSSTALK]
>> So if all goes well,

196
00:12:02.287 --> 00:12:06.382
we're gonna have a phrase or so
of the dance, the Es Stampede, the stomp,

197
00:12:06.382 --> 00:12:09.517
if you will, from the Middle Ages,
played on the Shawm.

198
00:12:09.517 --> 00:12:19.517
[MUSIC]

199
00:12:25.933 --> 00:12:30.308
Great, so that's a little taste
of music from the middle ages,

200
00:12:30.308 --> 00:12:34.766
specifically instrumental music,
specifically dance music,

201
00:12:34.766 --> 00:12:39.800
played on and demonstrated by Grant
here on the Vielle and on the Shawm.

202
00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:44.000
And we're gonna pick this up next time,
when we come to a session on music and

203
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.080
the renaissance.

204
00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.393
Thanks very much.
