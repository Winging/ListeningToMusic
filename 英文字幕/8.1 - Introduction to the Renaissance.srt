[MUSIC]

2
00:00:15.942 --> 00:00:18.570
Middle Ages, Renaissance.

3
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.720
What do these terms mean and
where do we get them?

4
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.010
Middle Ages,

5
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.920
well if they were in the middle of
something what was on either side?

6
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.550
Indeed two periods,
that are perhaps more stable and

7
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.460
perhaps more classical
in modes of thinking.

8
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.630
The Middle Ages then, were between
Classical Antiquity of Ancient Greece and

9
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.970
Rome and
the rebirth of classical ideas and

10
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.820
classical ideals in what
we call the renaissance.

11
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.360
Where do we get this term,
renaissance, rebirth?

12
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.570
Well that was first coined not until
the 19th century around 1860 by

13
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.010
a German historian Yaka Burkhart.

14
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.220
And it was intended to signal a renewed
interest in classical antiquity,

15
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.910
particularly of Ancient Rome.

16
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.940
Well, they say a picture is
worth a thousand words, so

17
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.430
let's have a look at one,
indeed more than one.

18
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.650
Here we see the Roman forum,
as it presently looks with the remains of

19
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.390
temples with columns and capitals,
both Corinthian and Ionic.

20
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.910
Now the famous Pantheon in the center
of Rome, again with columns,

21
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.740
capitols, a triangular penta metume,
and a rotunda.

22
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.970
Now we see architecture from 1500
years later, from the Renaissance,

23
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.820
from Palladio's Villa Rotonda near
Vincenza, Italy, but yet again,

24
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.790
the columns with Ionic capitals,
a triangular pedimentum, and a rotunda.

25
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.740
And now another view, straight on.

26
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.000
The Middle Ages were not so kind to Rome.

27
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.060
There was crime, organized and
disorganized, and decay.

28
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.170
The city of Rome went,
you'll never believe this, but it's true,

29
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.740
went from a population of more than
a million at the time of Caesar Augustus,

30
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.500
to somewhere around 25,000
in the 14th century.

31
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.910
Wolves ran through the sections
of the city, looking for corpses.

32
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.510
And the pope,
during most of the late middle ages,

33
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.670
didn't even reside in Rome for
nearly a century,

34
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.948
he lived in what was to become France
in what is today Avignon, France.

35
00:02:27.948 --> 00:02:33.920
By the mid-fifteenth century,
however, Rome was on the mend,

36
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.590
a period of economic ascend, ensued.

37
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.300
The Pope had returned, and
the citizens were starting to rebuild.

38
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.050
And they, and their fellow citizens
in city-states such as Florence and

39
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.180
Sienna, rebuilt and
refashioned society and in so

40
00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.460
doing, they asked,
How should city government work?

41
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.750
What should a building look like?

42
00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.970
What should a sculpture look like?

43
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.450
Where should it go?

44
00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.670
How should politicians behave?

45
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.890
How should a politician's
speech be organized and so on?

46
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.660
For answers they turned to models in
classical antiquity and made it reborn.

47
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.800
How did this renaissance apply to music?

48
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.480
Well less well, because almost everything
usable from classical antiquity,

49
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.060
the music itself and the musical
instruments have been lost or destroyed.

50
00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.860
There was as far as they knew,
no surviving music.

51
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.090
But they did have a lot of books on music
theory and many literary references that

52
00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.140
talked about how music was constructed and
how it worked in society.

53
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.590
One important point that Renaissance
musicians took away from these

54
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.110
reports about ancient music in classical
times was that it was powerful.

55
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.310
Music could move the listener, could have
a powerful emotional effect on the hearer.

56
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.860
So musicians of the renaissance devoted
a lot of time to creating a kind of

57
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.260
music that would move the listener and
they did so, as we will see,

58
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.000
by tying music to the text.

59
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.814
By having the music underscore,
reinforce, amplify,

60
00:04:13.814 --> 00:04:18.512
the meaning of the text in ways that
it hadn't during the Middle Ages.
