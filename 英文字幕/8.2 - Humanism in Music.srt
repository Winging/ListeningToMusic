[MUSIC]

2
00:00:13.334 --> 00:00:17.897
Humanism, let's begin our
discussion of musical humanism by

3
00:00:17.897 --> 00:00:22.901
taking a trip to the Renaissance
city par excellence, to Florence.

4
00:00:22.901 --> 00:00:26.780
We'll start with how it
looked in the Renaissance.

5
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:32.630
Here you see in the center the great Duomo
of Florence, to the left, over here,

6
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.390
the church of Santa Maria Novella,
the train station is right over there.

7
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.710
At the moment here we see
City Hall Palazzo Vecchio,

8
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.590
the Signoria where
the city fathers worked.

9
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.120
Now we're going to start up at the top of
this building with a slide that shows us

10
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.340
the city hall as it presently looks.

11
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.890
And now we're going to go
down to street level, and

12
00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.980
we are going to focus on this sculpture,
this statue right here.

13
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.370
And now we're going to
see that same sculpture.

14
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:11.550
On the right, a copy of the statue of
David by Michelangelo on the street.

15
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.190
On the left, the original where
it now rest inside the Accademia.

16
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.610
The original was brought
indoors In the 19th century.

17
00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.660
But before then the city had a tradition.

18
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.740
Florence had a tradition of displaying
the great works of art of its citizens for

19
00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.640
all to see.

20
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.360
But indoor or outdoor,
either way, this David

21
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.690
is very different from the sort of
sculpture that we saw in the Middle Ages.

22
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.410
Medieval sculpture, taking again,

23
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.980
an example from the beautiful Cathedral
of Chartres, tends to be fully clothed,

24
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.550
somewhat impersonal and
representing archetypes.

25
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.315
Michelangelo's David,
obviously, is very different.

26
00:01:57.315 --> 00:02:03.218
His seems to glorify, indeed revel in
the beauty of a perfect human form.

27
00:02:03.218 --> 00:02:04.918
And we have a name here,

28
00:02:04.918 --> 00:02:10.110
a human being associated with this
sculpture of David, Michelangelo.

29
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:20.290
By contrast, the most prolific artist in
the Middle Ages was Master Anonymous.

30
00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.070
Here we see the Cathedral of Chartres,
massive.

31
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.400
But we don't know who designed it or
who built it.

32
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.220
Now you see a tryptic of sorts.

33
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.570
And we've come to realize
that in the Middle Ages,

34
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.710
all inspiration came from, comes from God.

35
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.120
Hildegard on the right looks heavenward
for revelation and receives it.

36
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.890
The Holy Spirit, as see in the center
with St. Thomas, and on the left with St.

37
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.160
Gregory, the Holy Spirit
sits on their shoulder,

38
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.170
in the form of a dove
communicating the divine word.

39
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.380
Artists, as we see here in the next slide,
they didn't bother to sign their works.

40
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.750
Here we have three magnificent specimens,
but all three are anonymous.

41
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.410
But when we come into the Renaissance,
there's a real person.

42
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.200
The inspiration comes from God yes, but

43
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.390
a human can now shape it,
fashion it according to his vision.

44
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.431
And again, he has a name,
that of Leonardo or Michelangelo or

45
00:03:24.431 --> 00:03:27.080
of Shakespeare.

46
00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.760
And what these artists
created were oftentimes

47
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.350
works that gave pleasure
to other human beings.

48
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.750
Yes, they dealt with religion often, but
they also dealt with other themes as well

49
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.450
such as nature and
the delights of this world.

50
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.070
Here we see Botticelli's,
Springtime in the Uffizi in Florence.

51
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.540
And compare here the essence of youthful
beauty on the right from the Botticelli,

52
00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.060
from the Renaissance, with the abstract
medieval notion of a beautiful woman

53
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.770
on the left from the Middle Ages.

54
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.625
And there is a love of
the good things of this world.

55
00:04:08.625 --> 00:04:13.020
Here's Leonardo's portrait of the young
mistress of the Duke of Milan.

56
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.280
Well she's certainly well
coiffed in fine jewelry and

57
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.520
holding in her hand her pet ermine or
pet mink.

58
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.310
Life is good.

59
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.220
These human creators such as Leonardo
da Vinci were valuable as creators,

60
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.450
as artists.

61
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.440
And patrons fought over them.

62
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.170
Artists had rivalries with one another.

63
00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.060
Leonardo with Michelangelo,
they were not good friends.

64
00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.120
The musician,
Josquin des Prez in one case,

65
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.310
played one patron off against
another to double his salary.

66
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.980
And the artist could get rich.

67
00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.810
Michelangelo died with an estate of
about $10 million in today's money.

68
00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.060
And what these artists created could
be evaluated on a scale of good and

69
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.140
bad by other human beings.

70
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.780
The concept of artistic value,
of artistic criticism,

71
00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.440
of worth to society comes into
being during the Renaissance.

72
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.250
And even today we speak of humanism,
but more often of the the humanities.

73
00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.630
He's majoring in the humanities for
example.

74
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.780
Well, what exactly do we mean
by the study of the humanities?

75
00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:30.080
Well, evaluation, deep critical thinking,
comparison of literature, of the acts

76
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.990
of history, of art and of the history of
art, of music and of the history of music.

77
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.980
Comparison of styles and

78
00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.650
of composers, that's what we're
doing here in this course.

79
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.800
And it all goes back to the Renaissance.
