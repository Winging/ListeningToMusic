[MUSIC]

2
00:00:09.796 --> 00:00:13.000
Let's talk now about the musical
instruments of the renaissance.

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.970
And to do that we're going back
just a little bit in time.

4
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.900
Back into the late middle
ages into the mid-evil church

5
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.070
which takes us to this instrument.

6
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.200
The organ.

7
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.390
Organs really came into being in
churches not until the 14th century.

8
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.350
They first appeared in the big cathedrals.

9
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.390
And they were always placed high
on the walls of the church for

10
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.260
all to see and hear.

11
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.130
These powerful organs were
the marvel of the age.

12
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.000
The represented cutting edge technology,
a measurement of pipes, the density

13
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.610
of materials, the distribution of
a consistent and constant wind pressure.

14
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.710
They were the space shot
of the middle ages.

15
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.070
And so they were placed high so
that all could see.

16
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.360
Here we have the earliest surviving organ,

17
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.640
coming from the late 14th
century from Sion, Switzerland.

18
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.003
It's in playable condition, so
let's hear a bit of its sound.

19
00:01:16.003 --> 00:01:26.003
[MUSIC]

20
00:01:45.675 --> 00:01:52.695
Here we see two more organs, two slightly
later organs from the 15th century.

21
00:01:52.695 --> 00:01:56.180
On the left is a stationary one.

22
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.040
And then on the right, a movable one.

23
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.450
The stationary one on the left comes
from England or the low countries.

24
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.360
The one on the right comes from Germany.

25
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.930
The one on the left, because it is
stationary, is called a positive organ.

26
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.550
The one on the right, because it can
be moved around, a portative one.

27
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.550
So, positive, portative.

28
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.770
Here's a slide from Innsbruck,
Austria, 16th century.

29
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.990
We're moving a little later now into the
Renaissance, 16th century, as it sits in

30
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.420
what was then the Chapel of the Holy
Roman Emperor in Innsbruck, Austria.

31
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.950
It's now, of course, larger, and
it sits high on a wall as we have said.

32
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.930
And let's listen again to
that same organ music.

33
00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.250
That organ music was in fact written for

34
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.592
this particular organ by the German
composer Paul Hofheimer.

35
00:02:49.592 --> 00:02:58.472
[MUSIC]

36
00:02:58.472 --> 00:03:04.932
The Gregorian Chant, is actually
in the middle part, in the tenor.

37
00:03:04.932 --> 00:03:10.198
And up above, we have a great deal

38
00:03:10.198 --> 00:03:14.720
of musical ornamentation.

39
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.260
Embellishment in this
top part as you hear.

40
00:03:22.122 --> 00:03:26.015
All right, that was a quick introduction
to the organ of the late middle ages and

41
00:03:26.015 --> 00:03:29.740
renaissance, but
what about string keyboard instruments?

42
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.379
Well, they existed too from
the 14th century onward.

43
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.220
Let's look at a manuscript of
the 14th century, 14th century

44
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.860
dance music written for
a medieval string keyboard instrument.

45
00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.460
It actually comes from
the British library in London.

46
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.700
Notice that the musical notation of blood

47
00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.130
is a little bit similar to
our contemporary notation.

48
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.910
But underneath we have letter names A,
Bs, Cs.

49
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.676
I see a couple of Ds here,
C B flat, A and so on.

50
00:04:06.676 --> 00:04:09.180
So we had a dual system.

51
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.030
But it was eventually abandoned.

52
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.960
The letters were dropped, leaving musical
notation to develop as we know it today.

53
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:22.265
Let's hear just a little bit of this
dance music played by an early keyboard.

54
00:04:24.971 --> 00:04:34.971
[MUSIC]

55
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.892
Pretty cool, very attractive music.

56
00:05:09.892 --> 00:05:14.870
But for more discussion of these
renaissance instruments let's bring back

57
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.590
our expert, Bret Herod.

58
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.700
>> Okay.
Welcome back to another segment of

59
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.008
Introduction to classical music.

60
00:05:24.008 --> 00:05:26.840
Today we're gonna be dealing specifically
with music of the Renaissance, and

61
00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.180
even more specifically with musical
instruments and more, more,

62
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.400
more specifically with
keyboard instruments.

63
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.080
We're gonna start with
keyboard instruments.

64
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.370
So on the screen you see a representation,
a painting, 16th century

65
00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:44.110
Flemish painting in which a young
woman is playing the harpsichord.

66
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.160
And I have with me again today,
delighted to have my friend and colleague

67
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.540
Grant Herrod here who's an expert in this,
knows far more about it than I do.

68
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.590
To explain these sorts of things to us.

69
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.180
So what's of interest here with
this particular instrument,

70
00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.870
which I think is called a Clavichord.

71
00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.770
>> Yes, and this often played
by young ladies apparently.

72
00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.440
But what strikes us most is the hand
position showing very clearly.

73
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.800
>> [LAUGH]
>> That they did not use their thumbs.

74
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.750
>> Yeah.
Did you ever take piano lessons?

75
00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:11.300
>> Oh yeah.
[LAUGH]

76
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.030
>> So

77
00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.410
what would happen if your teacher
ever saw you playing like that?

78
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:16.740
>> I would have been slapped.

79
00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:17.240
>> Kaboom.
>> Yes.

80
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.040
>> Yeah you can't do that.

81
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.510
Really.
Through the time of Bach.

82
00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:22.080
Often at E.

83
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.320
Well Bach was the first to use the film,

84
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.500
but he was still using his 3
over 3 over 3 type of approach.

85
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.640
But it's interesting
because as we look at these

86
00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:37.140
keyboard instruments of the Renaissance,
we see that rather early on,

87
00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.130
they had somewhat advanced
instruments here.

88
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:45.440
So here is a representation, a detailed
diagram, of a keyboard instrument.

89
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.070
In this case a harpsichord
coming from the mid

90
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:53.160
15th century from the Court of Burgundy
from someone named Arnault de Zolle.

91
00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.480
It's preserved in
the Bibliotheque Nationale again.

92
00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.420
Here is, as you can see,
the shape of the instrument.

93
00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:01.650
Here are the keys down there.

94
00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:05.710
And if you had time,
you could even watch this run up

95
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:10.550
from low C up to the A at the top and
the chromatic notes.

96
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:14.040
It's a fully chromatic keyboard
here by the mid-15th century.

97
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.270
So Grant,
one thing that always puzzled me,

98
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:20.960
but probably the same thing on the loop,
what are these designs here?

99
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.770
Yes the decorated sound holes or
rosettes they would be called,

100
00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:27.960
just like the F and
C holes on string instruments,

101
00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.970
they just allow the sound to
escape from the sound box.

102
00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:33.840
>> Okay so
the sound is vibrating inside of

103
00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.100
these instruments
>> And

104
00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.280
you've got to let it out in some way.

105
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.204
>> Just like the sound hole in
a guitar but, a modern guitar, but

106
00:07:41.204 --> 00:07:44.300
in the Renaissance
everything was decorated and

107
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:48.620
they would not just have a big round
empty hole in their sound board?

108
00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:53.236
>> And the interesting thing here is,
in the upper right, where the inventor,

109
00:07:53.236 --> 00:07:57.993
Arnault de Zolle, gives us a very clear
diagram of the jack mechanism that would

110
00:07:57.993 --> 00:08:02.964
be the basis for sound production In the
harpsichord, which exists at this time but

111
00:08:02.964 --> 00:08:07.880
we are going to explore it a little bit
later on when we get to baroque music.

112
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.700
This time we are going to London,

113
00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.880
to the National Gallery in London
near Trafalgar Square there.

114
00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.220
And we see a painting,
16th century painting by Hans Holbein.

115
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:22.370
And you can see on the screen
the arrow that directs our

116
00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:27.940
attention to some musical materials,
specifically the Lute,

117
00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:33.760
and Grant's going to tell us a little
about the structure of the lute,

118
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.360
how it works, and
then he's going to demonstrate for us.

119
00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.520
>> You can see very clearly in
the foreground the peg box,

120
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:44.302
bent at an angle holding the twelve
pegs of this six-course instrument.

121
00:08:44.302 --> 00:08:46.533
And-
>> What's that mean, a course?

122
00:08:46.533 --> 00:08:52.247
>> The lute has pairs of strings

123
00:08:52.247 --> 00:08:58.634
[MUSIC]

124
00:08:58.634 --> 00:09:01.380
Although the top string,
the treble string, is usually a single.

125
00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.880
And so they're arranged in six pairs or
courses.

126
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:10.860
And you see in the depiction,

127
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:16.270
a lute very much like this one with frets,
pieces of gut, tied around the neck.

128
00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:18.046
Just to show you where
to put your fingers.

129
00:09:18.046 --> 00:09:24.235
And a round back,
always made of ribs of wood,

130
00:09:24.235 --> 00:09:28.320
glued together over a mold.

131
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:32.490
A decorated sound hole, as usual.

132
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:35.760
>> Again, as we said last time,
for the sound, so it can escape.

133
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.580
Let's look at another picture here,
because we see something called lute

134
00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:44.260
tablature, you have to be able to read
this special sort of notation, right?

135
00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:48.990
>> That's right, it's some of the earliest
music that we know was written for

136
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:52.890
a specific instrument is for
the lute, because of the tablature,

137
00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:56.870
or the system of notation,
that is peculiar to the lute.

138
00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:01.995
And here the young lady is playing, again,
this early kind of 16th century lute,

139
00:10:01.995 --> 00:10:04.894
but you see that she's
resting it on the table.

140
00:10:04.894 --> 00:10:07.864
[MUSIC]

141
00:10:07.864 --> 00:10:09.257
And by doing so,

142
00:10:09.257 --> 00:10:13.532
[MUSIC]

143
00:10:13.532 --> 00:10:17.855
it actually makes the lute slightly
more round and sound it a little louder.

144
00:10:17.855 --> 00:10:19.590
>> The table becomes a resonator.

145
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:23.730
>> Even a modern synthetic table, but

146
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:26.888
an old wooden table really
enhances the sound of the lute.

147
00:10:26.888 --> 00:10:29.315
>> That's remarkable.

148
00:10:29.315 --> 00:10:32.860
Well you want to play just
a little bit of something for us?

149
00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.097
Anything that strikes your fancy.

150
00:10:35.097 --> 00:10:45.097
[MUSIC]

151
00:10:47.361 --> 00:10:50.145
Lovely, and what was that by the way?

152
00:10:50.145 --> 00:10:51.592
Anything you made,
something you just made up?

153
00:10:51.592 --> 00:10:53.940
[LAUGH]
>> Something when I was feeling blue

154
00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:54.479
one day.

155
00:10:54.479 --> 00:10:56.890
>> I see.
You made that up, okay.

156
00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:59.240
But it sounded very much
in the Renaissance style,

157
00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.090
because it was modal, I guess.

158
00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:03.670
Let's see some more slides here.

159
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:08.567
We're going to take a look at one that
represents a typical early Renaissance

160
00:11:08.567 --> 00:11:09.480
dance scene.

161
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:14.090
Grant, once again,
here your is there up in the balcony.

162
00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:20.329
>> Yes, the alta capella, or loud man,
again playing their schawms and

163
00:11:20.329 --> 00:11:25.634
slide trumpet for
the accompaniment of probably.

164
00:11:25.634 --> 00:11:27.325
>> Mm-hm yeah.

165
00:11:27.325 --> 00:11:30.730
Probably a wedding scene and
then here they are in the upper right in

166
00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:36.080
the boudoir,
after the dancing in the banquet hall.

167
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:40.220
Now this is an interesting slide because
it's actually a cover of a record jacket,

168
00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:43.850
involving the ensemble Piffaro.

169
00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:45.010
And you are a member of that.

170
00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:46.364
>> I have played with Piffaro.

171
00:11:46.364 --> 00:11:47.626
>> How many years have
you played with him?

172
00:11:47.626 --> 00:11:48.970
>> Probably about 20 years.

173
00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:50.183
>> Oh yeah.

174
00:11:50.183 --> 00:11:51.863
I didn't realize it was 20 years old.

175
00:11:51.863 --> 00:11:53.125
You must have started when you were five.

176
00:11:53.125 --> 00:11:55.137
>> [LAUGH]
>> But what this is,

177
00:11:55.137 --> 00:12:00.494
is actually it was something on the wall
of the town hall in Nuremberg Germany,

178
00:12:00.494 --> 00:12:05.203
painted by Albrecht Durer, and
then later on somebody came along and

179
00:12:05.203 --> 00:12:08.870
did a specific painting
of this larger mural.

180
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:10.520
So we see a lot of
musical instruments here.

181
00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:16.720
And again, it's this standard Renaissance
band that Grant has been telling us about.

182
00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.110
So what instrument's do
we see here once more?

183
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:24.530
>> Right, we see the two shawms in
the foreground, leaning over the balcony.

184
00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:29.325
Next to them is sackbut,,
or the early trombone,

185
00:12:29.325 --> 00:12:34.250
which was a technological advancement

186
00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:38.610
over the earlier slide trumpet,
which was slightly more cumbersome.

187
00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:42.650
>> So let's take a look at another slide
here quickly, and as you can see, this one

188
00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:46.660
comes from the low countries around 1600s
probably even a little bit after that.

189
00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:49.260
But it's a particularly good
representation of some of

190
00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:50.210
those instruments.

191
00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:53.830
So what do we see here,
Grant, moving right to left?

192
00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:55.420
>> Right, well,
because it is a little later,

193
00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:57.940
they're probably playing five-part music.

194
00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:03.511
And we have a large sackbut but
playing the bass, two sort of alto sized

195
00:13:03.511 --> 00:13:08.624
shawms on the middle lines, and
on the top, a pair of cornetti.

196
00:13:08.624 --> 00:13:15.089
The corneto usually slightly curved
with a kind of a mouthpiece on the top,

197
00:13:15.089 --> 00:13:19.720
and it has finger holes like a recorder or
a clarinet.

198
00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:25.033
But the mouthpiece resembles
a brass instrument.

199
00:13:25.033 --> 00:13:30.840
And so it has very much a sound in
between a trumpet and sort of a recorder.

200
00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.914
>> We may get to hear this
a little bit later on.

201
00:13:33.914 --> 00:13:38.173
So this is a dinosaur, in a sense,
this instrument doesn't really.

202
00:13:38.173 --> 00:13:40.429
The Lute we still see around,

203
00:13:40.429 --> 00:13:45.574
the Trombone we still see around
in effect for the sackbut tombone,

204
00:13:45.574 --> 00:13:50.340
but we don't see many-
>> Yeah, the cornetto sort of died out.

205
00:13:52.462 --> 00:13:54.450
Right throughout the 17th century, and

206
00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:58.780
by the end of the 17th century hardly
anyone was playing it anymore it seems.

207
00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:02.055
>> Well, let's have a demonstration
of these various instruments now.

208
00:14:02.055 --> 00:14:03.020
Which should we start with?

209
00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:05.250
Maybe I guess historically,
you want to do the-

210
00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:07.400
>> I'll start with the cornetto, yeah.

211
00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:12.195
With the finger holes and
the trumpet-like mouth piece.

212
00:14:12.195 --> 00:14:20.635
[MUSIC]

213
00:14:20.635 --> 00:14:24.536
>> How many different, if you picked
up the lute, the sackbut, the viola.

214
00:14:24.536 --> 00:14:25.987
How many different instruments-
>> Let me try it one more time.

215
00:14:25.987 --> 00:14:27.992
>> No, no, how many different
instruments do you play?

216
00:14:27.992 --> 00:14:33.146
>> I play a lot of them to a point.

217
00:14:33.146 --> 00:14:35.197
You know, but
it's hard to specialize in all [CROSSTALK]

218
00:14:35.197 --> 00:14:38.409
>> So we're not expecting a performance.

219
00:14:38.409 --> 00:14:39.854
>> I'll just play it just a few notes.

220
00:14:39.854 --> 00:14:40.371
>> Okay.

221
00:14:40.371 --> 00:14:41.029
>> I'm sorry.

222
00:14:41.029 --> 00:14:43.680
>> No, [INAUDIBLE] it's great.

223
00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:48.340
Let's move on now to the brass instrument.

224
00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:50.750
We've got the slide trumpet,

225
00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:55.859
which is the precursor to the trombone,
right, I mean had this.

226
00:14:55.859 --> 00:14:56.935
>> Right.

227
00:14:56.935 --> 00:14:59.396
The trumpet can't play very many notes.

228
00:14:59.396 --> 00:15:07.558
[SOUND] Just the sort of fanfare
notes of the harmonic series, and so

229
00:15:07.558 --> 00:15:12.807
in the 14th century seems they developed

230
00:15:12.807 --> 00:15:20.114
this technology of making
the trumpet longer and shorter.

231
00:15:20.114 --> 00:15:30.114
[SOUND]

232
00:15:32.892 --> 00:15:33.774
>> Really cool.

233
00:15:33.774 --> 00:15:35.128
So, that's how the trombone got started.

234
00:15:35.128 --> 00:15:39.580
>> Well, it brought the trumpet players
into the sort of world of dance music,

235
00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:40.286
I imagine.

236
00:15:40.286 --> 00:15:45.664
But later part in the middle ages and
the early renaissance,

237
00:15:45.664 --> 00:15:50.199
they discovered that a double
slide made the work of

238
00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:55.174
changing the length of
the tubing much more efficient.

239
00:15:55.174 --> 00:16:02.544
[MUSIC]

240
00:16:02.544 --> 00:16:07.790
And the trombone, or
large trumpet, was invented.

241
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:10.869
Again, in England and France and
other countries, called the sackbut.

242
00:16:14.546 --> 00:16:18.675
>> Okay, well those are some of the dance
instruments of the renaissance.

243
00:16:18.675 --> 00:16:21.515
Let's take a look at,
by going to our screen now, and

244
00:16:21.515 --> 00:16:24.915
take a look at a manuscript.

245
00:16:24.915 --> 00:16:30.307
A rather fancy manuscript because it
was put together for a princess of

246
00:16:30.307 --> 00:16:36.457
the royal house in the low countries
in the late 15th, early 16th centuries.

247
00:16:36.457 --> 00:16:40.777
It's a so-called basch dance manual,
but it's rather kind of fancy.

248
00:16:40.777 --> 00:16:42.513
You ever worked with this at all or maybe?

249
00:16:42.513 --> 00:16:43.787
>> I have.

250
00:16:43.787 --> 00:16:47.790
And what's curious is that, it's just,

251
00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:50.800
every note is the same
length in a tenor range, and

252
00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:56.180
it seems that the early dance musicians
would use this to improvise over.

253
00:16:56.180 --> 00:17:01.100
>> Yeah, almost like a maybe a standard
blues pattern today, a certain length for

254
00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:04.700
one low bass note and then the next bass
notes got to go through so many bars and

255
00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:06.680
the next bass notes gotta go-
>> Very much.

256
00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:11.060
And, we've noticed in each of these
depictions of Renaissance Minstrels

257
00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:14.290
playing these instruments,
they are never reading music.

258
00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:17.930
And it seems that their specialty,
like a modern Dixieland band or

259
00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:20.910
something was to learn
a bunch of repertory, and

260
00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:25.950
be able to play by ear, from memory,
and of course improvising dance music.

261
00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:29.250
>> Yeah, and of course all popular
musicians operate that way today.

262
00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:30.910
Why would they ever need music?

263
00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:32.780
They're really good musicians.

264
00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:33.280
>> Right.

265
00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:38.974
>> Okay, so that's an actual dancing
manual because underneath here,

266
00:17:38.974 --> 00:17:43.079
if you can see these other letters,
you can see the r for [FOREIGN],

267
00:17:43.079 --> 00:17:48.020
a big sweeping bow, and then the little
shake, or equivalent of the [FOREIGN].

268
00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:52.548
And then two [FOREIGN] and
a couple of [FOREIGN] in a row, and on.

269
00:17:52.548 --> 00:17:56.660
So this manuscript is giving us
the steps for the dance, as well.

270
00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:59.270
And if you're really good,
we will demonstrate the dance for

271
00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:01.620
you a little bit later on.

272
00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.130
And a final slide.

273
00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:04.710
Let's look at this one.

274
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:07.290
We can't be sure this is
really Queen Elizabeth or not.

275
00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:13.310
In some corners it's thought to be Queen
Elizabeth, some not thought to be her.

276
00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:20.560
And it clearly a representation
of a couple here dancing

277
00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:25.490
a galliard,
which was a fast leaping dance.

278
00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:28.270
Galliard was preceded by a pavane.

279
00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:31.020
Here we can see some of the stringed
instruments accompanying.

280
00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.260
But this pair of pavane and

281
00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:37.400
galliard became the standard
dances of the Renaissance.

282
00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:43.330
You'll remember that we saw a dancing
manual from the Renaissance.

283
00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:45.650
That manuscript written in silver and

284
00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:49.840
gold on black vellum, with the music and
dance steps written in.

285
00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:54.770
The two principal dances of the
Renaissance were, again, the Pavane and

286
00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:56.230
the Galliard.

287
00:18:56.230 --> 00:19:01.360
The pavane was a slow, stately dance
recommended for processions and

288
00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:03.550
dances involving old people.

289
00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:08.870
The galliard, as we saw with our leaping
queen, probably Queen Elizabeth I,

290
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:11.790
was much faster and more athletic.

291
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:14.640
To give you a sense of the slow,

292
00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:18.930
stately pavane, I conned my friend
Grant Harrod to dance with me.

293
00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:20.480
Remember what Grant pointed out.

294
00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.530
Not only did men and women dance together,
but women danced with women in

295
00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:28.900
the Renaissance and the Middle Ages,
and men danced with men.

296
00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:31.550
Gender didn't matter all that much.

297
00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:33.978
Getting the steps right did.

298
00:19:33.978 --> 00:19:37.982
Again, we'll now see a Renaissance pavane,

299
00:19:37.982 --> 00:19:42.511
danced with music supplied
by the ensemble Pifaro.

300
00:19:42.511 --> 00:19:52.511
[MUSIC]
