00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.740
[FOREIGN]
>> Despite

2
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.740
the popularity of instrumental
dance music in the Renaissance,

3
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.720
sacred religious music from
the Renaissance continued to thrive.

4
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.470
Sacred music for
the Roman Catholic Church.

5
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.560
Some of it later for
the Protestant Church as we'll soon see.

6
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.040
But for the religious music of
the Catholic church in the Renaissance,

7
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.590
we need to go back to Rome.

8
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.750
Here we see obviously, the front of St.

9
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.460
Peter's, with the Pope's quarters and
the Sistine Chapel on the right.

10
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.310
Now looking in the opposite direction
we see Saint Peter's on the right and

11
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.498
the papal quarters on the left.

12
00:00:49.498 --> 00:00:51.550
Now we're gonna go up on
the top of Saint Peter's and

13
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.070
look down at the Sistine Chapel and
the papal apartments.

14
00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.960
The papal stanzas, rooms,
as they are called.

15
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.290
Some of which are beautifully
decorated by Frescoes by Raphael.

16
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.450
Here is his School of Athens from
around 1500 in which he painted, and

17
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.690
I think I can point this out to you,
he painted Leonardo here,

18
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.770
he painted Michelangelo here and
he painted himself, Raphael, right here.

19
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.060
But back to the rooftop.

20
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.070
So here's the roof of the Sistine Chapel,
now we're gonna go on the other side of

21
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.950
that roof to see Michelangelo's
famous creation, the ceiling

22
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.050
of the Sistine Chapel with Creation and
the Expulsion of Adam and Eve.

23
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:48.660
And now we're gonna switch to the high
alter end of the Sistine Chapel.

24
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.160
And the Last Judgement by Michelangelo,
notice here

25
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.920
on the lower right, the gallery,
see if I can point to it right here.

26
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.790
The gallery, this was the or the balcony,
this is where the singers came out and

27
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.880
stood during the services, and
they still do today at this spot.

28
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.080
They were grouped around a lectern,
as we see, not from Italy, but

29
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.660
from France in this period.

30
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.390
But it's a particularly good view of
the lectern, all grouped around the music,

31
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.730
up in front of them there,
all singing together.

32
00:02:26.938 --> 00:02:30.570
Now I wanna go over to Saint Peter's
just for a moment and make a point.

33
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.780
This is a very big church,
the largest church in the world.

34
00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.250
As you look around here,

35
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.320
there's one thing that's missing
that's found in most churches.

36
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:46.036
It's missing too in the Sistine Chapel and

37
00:02:46.036 --> 00:02:48.742
that's the organ.

38
00:02:48.742 --> 00:02:51.623
The only organ that I
could recently find at St.

39
00:02:51.623 --> 00:02:56.030
Peters was this one, a small one tucked
away in the Nave of the Basilica.

40
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.670
Organs and instruments generally did not
play a role in the religious music here,

41
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.190
and certainly not in the Sistine Chapel.

42
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.470
In the Sistine Chapel there was always,
and

43
00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.540
is still today, a tradition of
singing without instruments.

44
00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.960
So we have this term,
A Capella Sistina in the Sistine Chapel.

45
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.140
And from it, we derive this term
A Capella, A Capella singing.

46
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.644
The music performed here
in the Sistine Chapel,

47
00:03:28.644 --> 00:03:32.670
in the Renaissance and
ever since is in A Capella style.

48
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:40.970
But let's hear some of that music and
to do so we turn to the music [FOREIGN].

49
00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.330
Here is a wood cut of this composure made
in the 17th century from a lost painting.

50
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.170
And here is an original manuscript,
still in the Vatican collection,

51
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.720
showing a mass by Josquin for four voices.

52
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.990
Here at the top with the red arrow,
you can see Jousquinous Desprez.

53
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.100
Four voice mass, soprano and

54
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:09.220
tenor on the left side of the page
alto and bass on the right.

55
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.200
Music in the Renaissance
was rarely arranged

56
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.330
vertically in score as we have it today.

57
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:21.220
But here is a modern vertical
score of a Monnet by Jacque.

58
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.470
A motet is a genre of sacred music.

59
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.740
Usually setting a Latin text
intended to be sung in church or

60
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.060
possibly in a devotional context at home.

61
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:40.220
In the Renaissance the motet was almost
always written in polyphonic texture and

62
00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.230
involved imitation.

63
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.880
Here you can see the numbers on the score,
I've labeled them obviously one,

64
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.660
two, three, and four and

65
00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.580
these represent little themes or
motifs that are sung in imitation.

66
00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.770
So we've mentioned a number of terms here.

67
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.850
Let's review these terms
by means of the next slide.

68
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.820
A Capella means of course singing
without instrumental accompaniment.

69
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.370
Motet, a genre of religious music.

70
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.790
Usually setting a Latin text,

71
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.580
virtually anything other than
devotional music besides a mass.

72
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.170
Polyphony, obviously more
than one voice at a time.

73
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.000
Imitation, voices repeating for

74
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.760
a short period of time what
a preceding voice had done.

75
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.460
And voice pairing, well,

76
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.730
two voices could play off against
another set of two voices.

77
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.480
We'll see that in just a minute.

78
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.690
All right, now let's see how this
works in a motet by Josquin.

79
00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.100
Here is his Ave Maria.

80
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.850
We'll start with just the Latin
text that Josquin is setting here.

81
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.640
It tells the story of the virgin
as recorded in the Bible and

82
00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.580
expanded on during the Middle Ages.

83
00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.860
Josquin structured his music
around the existing structure

84
00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.490
of this particular chant, Ave Maria.

85
00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.960
He doesn't borrow the chant,
just the text.

86
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:16.570
But he emphasizes the structure of
the text through the music he creates.

87
00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.660
In a particular way.

88
00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.540
Each starts with a tune line
salutation as you can see here.

89
00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:28.030
Ave Maria grazia playing hail Mary we
will be with you serene virgin and so on.

90
00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:32.050
Then follow a succession of five stanzas.

91
00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:37.160
You won't see them all here, but
five stanzas each with four lines

92
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:42.190
that run the various events
in the life of the virgin,

93
00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.700
conception, her birth,
enunciation, and so on.

94
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:52.020
And finally it ends with
another two line petition,

95
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.460
petition peroration if you will.

96
00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:01.280
Petition to the virgin to intercede on
behalf of the petitioner, the listener.

97
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.930
At the hour of our death.

98
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:08.500
Josquin sets this text as we
have seen in a particular way.

99
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:13.700
It has a particular structure
that gives it humanistic clarity.

100
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.683
Okay, so let's listen to this piece now.

Well, no matter what your religion is,
that's gorgeous.

159
00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:59.220
It's also a fine example
of form in a Renaissance.

160
00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:04.050
Two lines, plus five times four lines,
plus two lines.

161
00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:05.660
24 lines in all.

162
00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:07.970
It's balanced and it's symmetrical.

163
00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:12.750
More humanistic rhetoric
designed to persuade.

164
00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:14.530
Balanced and symmetrical.

165
00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.670
And let's remember, balance and

166
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:21.380
symmetry were very important in
the architecture of the renaissance.

167
00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:25.960
Here we see the symmetrical structure
in Palladio's Villa Rotunda.

168
00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.970
And it was important in painting.

169
00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:32.750
In paintings by Rafael and Leonardo.

170
00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:37.105
The renaissance was very much
a balanced classical age.
