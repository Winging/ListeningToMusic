4
00:00:08.387 --> 00:00:13.418
In the early 16th century another
religion, initially a splinter group, or

5
00:00:13.418 --> 00:00:18.523
breakaway group, began to protest the
practices of the Roman Catholic Church,

6
00:00:18.523 --> 00:00:23.140
protests with regards to
religious doctrine and economics.

7
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.730
The flow of money heading south
from Germany into Italy and

8
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.800
specifically to Rome.

9
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.250
They ultimately were call
the Protest Tents, or the Protestants.

10
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.020
Here's a painting of the man who initiated
the Protestant Reformation, Martin Luther.

11
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.990
Luther was not only a theologian but
a skilled musician.

12
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:50.070
Indeed, his favorite composer was
the fore-heard Josquin Des Prez.

13
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.640
"The notes regulate (control) other
composers with Josquin, however,

14
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.690
he governs the notes." And indeed,
Martin Luther himself was a composer.

15
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.489
Here you see a slide of a a tenor.

16
00:01:07.489 --> 00:01:11.570
Let's take a look at the specifics
with the pointer here.

17
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.524
Up at the top, we see the 46 there.

18
00:01:16.524 --> 00:01:20.654
What would that be [FOREIGN].

19
00:01:20.654 --> 00:01:28.660
So, this is in Latin,
written by Martinus Luther.

20
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:34.780
But the text here of this song
that Luther created is in German.

21
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.210
German was supposed to be part of
the service of the Lutheran religion.

22
00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.640
This is a composition again
that Luther himself created.

23
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.700
We call it a chorale,
what other denominations would call

24
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.190
simply a hymn tune, so Martin Luther
has created a choral tune here.

25
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.090
We're going to listen to it.

26
00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.690
And as we listen to it,
notice that it is actually in octaves.

27
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.880
But each of the octaves is
separated according to voice.

28
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.650
We have a bass voice, a tenor voice,
and a female voice in the soprano.

29
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:11.600
So, let's hear it now.

30
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:21.600
Monophonic texture.
>> [MUSIC]

31
00:03:06.342 --> 00:03:07.127
>> So, that's the first strophy
from this tenor part book.

32
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.410
Talk about that in a moment.

33
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.770
Just has the music for
the tenor not the other parts in it.

34
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.000
All right, let's take a look here
by of what about what we just said.

35
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.570
Let's take a look at a slide
that gives us some terms.

36
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.660
Protestant Reformation,
Martin Luther, Chorale Tune,

37
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.180
again same thing as a Hymn Tune,
Part Book.

38
00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.990
By that we mean a book
containing just one vocal part.

39
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.680
Monophonic texture that we heard there.

40
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.820
Polyphonic texture,

41
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.640
well let's go back and listen to that and
we could even throw in here the term

42
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.850
homophonic texture because in a way
that's what we have with the next slide.

43
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.130
Let's take a look at the next slide and
before we get to it.

44
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.710
Let's observe the following that we're
not going to have the music here

45
00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:03.090
be exactly what the music we see on
the screen be exactly what we are hearing.

46
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.240
We are going to hear
Luther's original music

47
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.390
helped along here by
an arrangement by Yohan Valter.

48
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.520
Luther's original music With a score,

49
00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.750
certainly a different score,
from the 19th century.

50
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.260
The melody that you will hear,

51
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.416
you'll see in the soprano part is
actually being sung in the tenor line.

52
00:04:21.416 --> 00:04:25.760
Let's have a listen.

53
00:04:29.724 --> 00:04:30.771
>> [MUSIC]

55
00:05:02.535 --> 00:05:06.275
>> Maybe we'll fade that out now.

56
00:05:06.275 --> 00:05:10.580
Let's take a look at a map,
see where we are.

57
00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.420
By the mid 15th century
most of northern Europe

58
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.670
had blown over to the Protestant cause.

59
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.830
Cities such as Augsburg and Munich,
well they were sort of half and half.

60
00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:19.720
Swing cities.

61
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:25.640
Vienna was still fully Catholic,
Innsbruck, and so on down to Italy.

62
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.640
The Catholic church who has since
fought back in the form of the counter

63
00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.940
reparation and for the counter reparation
we're going to go back to Rome and

64
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.580
take a look at an image of St.
Peters as it is being built.

65
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:42.470
So, here we are.

66
00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.600
In the Vatican,
this is the Sistine Chapel here.

67
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.640
This is the roof of the Sistine Chapel.

68
00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:56.450
This is the great dome of St.
Peter's designed in part by Michelangelo.

69
00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:04.720
You can even see the workmen up there
Let's go into the Sistine Chapel.

70
00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.670
This was, again,
the time of the counter-reformation and

71
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.930
the Council of Trent.

72
00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.030
What was the Council of Trent?

73
00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:16.900
Well, it was a gathering
of all the leaders,

74
00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.100
all the male leaders of the church.

75
00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.660
To determine how to respond to
the protestant reformation.

76
00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:31.680
On this slide you see that victory, here,
will be that of the faithful Catholics.

77
00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.330
You see the allegorical figure of
victory wearing a papal tiara.

78
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:43.512
Now, the foremost composer of
counter reformation music was.

79
00:06:43.512 --> 00:06:48.770
He wrote in a pure clear style,
not too much imitation so

80
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.390
that the faithful could focus ont he text,
so that they could understand the text and

81
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:55.440
not just enjoy the music.

82
00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.170
Because of this pure style of church music

83
00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:02.300
He was said to be
the savior of church music.

84
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.600
The savior of needless to say,
Roman Catholic church music.

85
00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:12.250
Here we have an image of Palestrina
on the right, presenting a volume

86
00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:17.600
of his Salvific masses to Pope Marcellis.

87
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.940
In the 1560s.

88
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.160
But let's think about.

89
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.680
You can see the soprano
part on this piece here.

90
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:30.870
Let's think about how the sopranos were
actually performed in this period.

91
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:33.030
Who sang the soprano line?

92
00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:39.150
Well, there were three possibilities And
one of them was not having women singing

93
00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:44.650
the soprano or alto part because,
ever since the Bible,

94
00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:49.940
there had been this proscription
against women singing in the church.

95
00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:56.720
Mulier taceat in ecclesia,
the woman should be Silent in the church.

96
00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.840
Well if that's the case,
who is going to sing the voice parts then?

97
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.740
Well, three possibilities,
as you can see here.

98
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:08.710
First, males singing in falsetto,
we've heard that already today,

99
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:09.580
we'll hear more of it.

100
00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:14.040
Secondly, choir boys,
here's a good image of that, fresco...

101
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:20.500
Showing choir boy down below, and
older toncert clerics behind him.

102
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.840
And a third possibility was the castrato.

103
00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:29.970
Castratis entered the Sistine Chapel
during the 1560s, and then,

104
00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:36.108
during the 17th and 18th century,
because they became important in opera.

105
00:08:36.108 --> 00:08:40.670
They become something similar to

106
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:44.610
the rockstar of the stage
because of their high voices,

107
00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:49.180
their powerful voices, and the capacity,
as you can see by this account here.

108
00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:55.190
Their capacity to hold a note for
an unbelievable amount of time.

109
00:08:55.190 --> 00:09:00.750
Let's take a look at this slide from
a recent film called Farinelli.

110
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:04.570
As they say, they were something
of the rock stars of the 17th and

111
00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:09.200
18th century, and we will come back to
this when we come back to Hendle and

112
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.525
the opera in the 18th century.

113
00:09:11.525 --> 00:09:16.505
And and
although this tradition of the castrato

114
00:09:16.505 --> 00:09:21.755
died out in opera, in the early
nineteenth century, around 1830,

115
00:09:21.755 --> 00:09:25.985
it held on in the papal chapel
into the early twentieth century.

116
00:09:25.985 --> 00:09:31.535
Here you see an image of
the last living castrato,

117
00:09:31.535 --> 00:09:36.070
Alessandro Moreschi He happened
to be recorded by accident.

118
00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:37.980
They wanted to record
the Pope at that time.

119
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:42.320
The Pope is busy, so they took their
recording equipment here in 1904,

120
00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:46.770
next door over into the Sistine Chapel,
and asked Moreschi to sing for him.

121
00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:48.830
Now, Moreschi was very old at this time.

122
00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:54.180
He was about 70, and needless to say,
this recording of 19 1904 was

123
00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:58.830
very early so the sound,
the audio is terrible but

124
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:03.380
at least it gives you a taste
of this extraordinary voice.

125
00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:10.035
The sound of the last, in this case,

126
00:10:10.035 --> 00:10:14.981
the last living castrato.

127
00:10:14.981 --> 00:10:20.960

[MUSIC]

129
00:11:18.478 --> 00:11:22.004
>> Well, as I say,
it was all the acoustics here and

130
00:11:22.004 --> 00:11:24.760
the audio equipment here is not good.

131
00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:29.200
But at least it gives us a hint of this
eerie sound of the Castrato voice.

132
00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:34.380
Let's turn now to a modern video.

133
00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:41.060
Here we have The Tallis singers,
Tallis scholars, with peter Phillips.

134
00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:46.510
For my money, the finest acapella singing
group in the world, year after year.

135
00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:51.070
No matter what group he has put together,
the intonation and the balance and

136
00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:53.690
interpretations are always extraordinary.

137
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.370
Here we have two choirs.

138
00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:59.240
One that you see in front
of us with five singers.

139
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.340
Over top of the lady in blue,

140
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.310
we have two gentleman there that
will singing a Gregorian Chant, and

141
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:11.615
then faintly Here in the distance
in another chapel, another choir.

142
00:12:11.615 --> 00:12:14.215
And they will be singing in a way,
that once again,

143
00:12:14.215 --> 00:12:18.605
tends to recreate the sound
of the castrati voice.

144
00:12:18.605 --> 00:12:22.985
So, we will begin this with
Peter Phillips conducting.

145
00:12:22.985 --> 00:12:26.006

168
00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:48.140
walked back to his hotel room with his
father and copied it down note for note.

169
00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:53.770
Remarkable, but so too is this
sound of the lost castrato voice.

170
00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:59.040
But whether by Josquin des Prez or
Palestrina or

171
00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:04.070
his later contemporary Allegri,
this is wonderful a cappella choral music.

172
00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:08.708
Indeed, the renaissance is known
as The age of a capella singing.
