[MUSIC]

2
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.049
We said that in the Renaissance,
written composed music became

3
00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:16.290
available in written form,
to a broader segment of society.

4
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.962
This was part of the humanizing
of the Renaissance, and

5
00:00:19.962 --> 00:00:23.620
it was driven in large
measure by technology.

6
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.980
Technology changed what art was and
how people experienced the world,

7
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.920
just as technology determines
what art is today, and

8
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.870
how we experience the world,
how we hear music.

9
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.534
The technological revolution of the
Renaissance was, of course, the printing

10
00:00:43.534 --> 00:00:48.523
press, invented in Germany on the banks
of the Rhine River about 1450 or so.

11
00:00:48.523 --> 00:00:53.100
And from there it spread to Italy,
first to Venice and then Rome and

12
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.010
then to France in Lyon and Paris.

13
00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.570
These became the music publishing
centers of Western Europe.

14
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.560
On the screen you see
the finished product.

15
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.518
This is just one part, here again,
a tenor part book for a mass.

16
00:01:11.518 --> 00:01:16.093
A singer would buy the book for just his
part book, or possibly for secular music,

17
00:01:16.093 --> 00:01:20.690
her part book, the soprano voice,
the alto voice, the tenor voice, whatever.

18
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.680
Why would you need the other parts?

19
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.450
You just needed your own music,
except if you got lost,

20
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.330
you needed to peg off of or
reference off of the other parts.

21
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.790
Here on the screen now we see an image
of a printing press in action,

22
00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.060
we see men working with movable type.

23
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.760
Pressmen creating multiple
sheets that had to be cut and

24
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.620
these sheets had to be bound.

25
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.980
And the proofreader had
to vet all of this,

26
00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.620
had to vet guarantee the finished product.

27
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.830
This is from a French image from Paris.

28
00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:00.190
And we know that there was an important
music printing working in Paris at

29
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.330
this time in the 1530s,
one Pierre Attaingnant.

30
00:02:04.675 --> 00:02:09.130
Let's look at the title page
from one of his prints.

31
00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.360
Here you can see one that reads,

32
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.680
30 Musical [FOREIGN] In Four Voices,
etc., etc.

33
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.916
New pieces printed by Pierre Attaingnant,

34
00:02:19.916 --> 00:02:25.121
A-T-T-A-I-N-G-N-A-N-T, living at,

35
00:02:25.121 --> 00:02:29.820
[FOREIGN] and so
on near the church of such and such.

36
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.110
And here are the 30 or so
pieces in this collection and

37
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.960
it is simply a part broke,
the Superius part broke.

38
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.340
But he tells us who he is and
where he's living.

39
00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.616
And based on this and the location of
that church, we can actually see where

40
00:02:44.616 --> 00:02:49.835
he was working here on the left bank,
within a block or so of the Sorbonne.

41
00:02:49.835 --> 00:02:57.487
And interestingly enough, there's still
a bookstore, [FOREIGN], on that very spot.

42
00:02:57.487 --> 00:03:02.310
Now let's see some of these part
books as they were actually viewed.

43
00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.000
Here we see a trio, the young lady playing
on a flute from a soprano part book,

44
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.900
while another singer sings, presumably
from another part book in the back and

45
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.770
a lute fills out the harmony.

46
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.880
Of course, this was communal music.

47
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.810
It was fun, but
everybody was to be a participant.

48
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.680
It wasn't any such thing as
an audience as we think of it,

49
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.060
a large gathering of
people who just listened.

50
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.580
Now let's see a slide from Paris,
actually downtown Paris.

51
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.635
If you look in the background here,
you can see the spires of Notre Dame.

52
00:03:37.635 --> 00:03:41.480
We saw that from the other
side in our session 7.

53
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.670
Again, here is the park book
with someone singing out of it,

54
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.960
conducting and
a flute is playing the soprano part.

55
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:59.580
Generally speaking, much of this secular
music was sung just one to a part.

56
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.610
Sometimes with instruments but
often times, a capella.

57
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:09.740
So here we have a group all singing out of
a part book, three ladies and a gentleman.

58
00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:15.130
He seems to be conducting given the hand
position that he's gesturing with.

59
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.080
Let's listen to this.

60
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:22.627
It's a chanson by Attaingnant Tant que
vivrai performed here by Voices and Lute.

61
00:04:26.306 --> 00:04:36.306
[MUSIC]

62
00:04:59.265 --> 00:05:03.389
Now Pierre Atoniogne was
an enterprising fellow, and

63
00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:08.270
arranged for these songs in
every sort of different way.

64
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.050
He wanted to make, to be bumped as much
money as he could on this enterprise.

65
00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.400
So he raised them for voices, for
voices and instruments, for lute, for

66
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.870
lute and voice, recorders,
keyboard, alone, and so on.

67
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.241
Here's a harpsichord,
from slightly later after 1600.

68
00:05:24.241 --> 00:05:25.857
It's in the Yale Collection.

69
00:05:25.857 --> 00:05:28.782
Let's listen to the same chanson,

70
00:05:28.782 --> 00:05:33.668
Tant que vivrai, but
now arranged for harpsichord alone.

71
00:05:33.668 --> 00:05:43.668
[MUSIC]

72
00:06:07.771 --> 00:06:12.099
And this brings us to the most popular
kind of vocal music of the Renaissance,

73
00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:13.730
the madrigal.

74
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:19.460
The madrigal is a genre, again a type of
music, involving several solo voices,

75
00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.850
usually four or five,
that sets to music a poem.

76
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:27.100
Most often a poem about love or
of love frustrated.

77
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.220
Usually only one singer sings each part.

78
00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:35.698
And most often the madrigal was performed
acapella, no accompanying instruments.

79
00:06:35.698 --> 00:06:39.480
More than 2,000 separate books

80
00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.650
of madrigals published during
the Renaissance, first in Italy and

81
00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:46.690
then in the low countries, and
in Germany and in England.

82
00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.030
Usually there were 20 madrigals or
so in each volume.

83
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.745
So you can see that they're
somewhere between 30,000 and

84
00:06:53.745 --> 00:06:57.650
40,000 of these madrigals created.

85
00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:00.776
I suppose singing the madrigal
was something of a rage,

86
00:07:00.776 --> 00:07:05.100
perhaps the way doo-wop was, or
maybe folk singing in the 1960s.

87
00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.720
Let's review all this
by means of this slide.

88
00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:08.870
Madrigal, what is it?

89
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.380
Well, it's a genre of vocal music sung,
not in Latin, but

90
00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:13.680
in the vernacular language.

91
00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.130
It could be English, it could be Italian.

92
00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.320
Where was it generated?

93
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.970
Well, first in Italy, around 1530, and
then it spread to the rest of Europe.

94
00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:25.000
How many?
Well, as we said, thousands.

95
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.092
Maybe as many as 40,000.

96
00:07:27.092 --> 00:07:31.370
By the time it reached England,
we were in the Elizabethan Age,

97
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:33.360
the age of Queen Elizabeth I.

98
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:39.180
There were a number of important
musicians working at her court,

99
00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.260
associated with her and
with London generally.

100
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:48.040
Thomas Morley, William Byrd, Orlando
Gibbons, John Wilbey, Thomas Weelkes and

101
00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.588
collectively they formed what's
call the English Madrigal School.

102
00:07:51.588 --> 00:07:55.530
So we're gonna take a listen to now,
just one Madrigal

103
00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:59.760
out of an important collection
called the Triumphes of Oriana 1601,

104
00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:04.920
a collection of, again,
roughly 20 or so of these Madrigals.

105
00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.140
This collection is interesting
because each one of them,

106
00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:11.620
in order to be included in this
collection, you had to end your Madrigal

107
00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:17.500
with the salutation,
long live fair Oriana.

108
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:21.130
Oriana was the favored
nickname of Queen Elizabeth.

109
00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:24.390
So each of these madrigals ends this way.

110
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:28.730
We're going to turn our
attention now to the madrigal

111
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:33.600
As Vesta was from Latmos Hill Descending,
by Thomas Weelkes.

112
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:39.710
Again, you can see on the screen here
six vocal parts to six part madrigal.

113
00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:42.440
Each of the parts would be
sung only by one voice.

114
00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:47.470
And only four of the voices,
the top four voices start out.

115
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:50.770
But let's move on now to three images.

116
00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:56.860
One of the composer Wilkes who
wrote this madrigal in 1601.

117
00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:00.190
Second, in the middle of course,
Queen Elizabeth the first,

118
00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:02.040
the dedicatee of this madrigal.

119
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.140
And third, my friend and
former colleague here at Yale before,

120
00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:09.150
his regretted retirement,
Simon Carrington who is the founder and

121
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:12.950
conductor for years and
years of the King Singers.

122
00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:17.390
So we're gonna turn now to
a recording of the king singers.

123
00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.400
And in it we're going
to hear the following.

124
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:24.091
We're going to listen to this madrigal
As Vesta was from hill descending.

125
00:09:24.091 --> 00:09:28.250
It's full of what we call word painting or
madrigalisms.

126
00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:33.030
Moments when the music
underscores the text in a direct

127
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:38.240
Onomatopoeic way,
music in the service of text.

128
00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.790
So, I'll talk a bit as we proceed.

129
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:46.595
Let's see this music now
sung by the King's Singers.

130
00:09:46.595 --> 00:09:53.699
[MUSIC]

131
00:09:53.699 --> 00:09:55.614
Descending now.

132
00:09:55.614 --> 00:09:58.134
[MUSIC]

133
00:09:58.134 --> 00:10:02.090
That music of course is graded down,
so everybody's coming down.

134
00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:03.390
Latvis hill, what do they see?

135
00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:07.417
They see the Queen ascending,
so the music has to go up here.

136
00:10:07.417 --> 00:10:15.033
[MUSIC]

137
00:10:15.033 --> 00:10:16.611
Attended on by all.

138
00:10:16.611 --> 00:10:19.130
Well we'll have a lot of voices
here cuz everybody's in.

139
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:23.959
[MUSIC]

140
00:10:23.959 --> 00:10:26.451
All six voices singing in [INAUDIBLE]

141
00:10:26.451 --> 00:10:31.651
[MUSIC]

142
00:10:31.651 --> 00:10:34.370
So Diana's darlings,
those attending the goddess Diana,

143
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:35.924
they came running down a-mains.

144
00:10:35.924 --> 00:10:39.325
So, it's going to go fast and downward.

145
00:10:39.325 --> 00:10:49.622
[MUSIC]

146
00:10:49.622 --> 00:10:50.283
Two by two?

147
00:10:50.283 --> 00:10:51.340
Yes, two voice.

148
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:53.540
Three by three?

149
00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:54.590
Yes, three voices.

150
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:58.851
[MUSIC]

151
00:10:58.851 --> 00:10:59.930
You guessed it.

152
00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:02.044
[MUSIC]

153
00:11:02.044 --> 00:11:02.949
All alone.

154
00:11:02.949 --> 00:11:12.366
[MUSIC]

155
00:11:12.366 --> 00:11:16.430
And mingling with
the Shepard's,&nbsp;well, we're&nbsp;gonna

156
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:20.180
mingle here poly-phonically with
lots of imitation, busy music.

157
00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:26.785
[MUSIC]

158
00:11:26.785 --> 00:11:29.920
Then sang, well everybody together now,
announcement.

159
00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:34.215
[MUSIC]

160
00:11:34.215 --> 00:11:37.535
All the nymphs of Diana sang.

161
00:11:37.535 --> 00:11:39.276
Long live Oriana.

162
00:11:39.276 --> 00:11:40.855
[MUSIC]

163
00:11:40.855 --> 00:11:45.672
And they sing this for
a very long time in imitation with

164
00:11:45.672 --> 00:11:48.923
the bass singing in very long notes.

165
00:11:48.923 --> 00:11:58.923
[MUSIC]

166
00:12:28.533 --> 00:12:31.681
Sometimes the memetic nature of the music,

167
00:12:31.681 --> 00:12:35.935
the memetic nature of the music,
underscoring each word or

168
00:12:35.935 --> 00:12:41.410
phrase with an appropriate music
gesture gets down right silly.

169
00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:45.010
But this development is hugely
important in the history of music.

170
00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:48.470
It developed a vocabulary
of musical expression.

171
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:51.340
We can talk about the different periods
in the history of music, Medieval,

172
00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.570
Renaissance, Baroque and so on.

173
00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:58.430
But the two most important changes in
the history of Western music arguably,

174
00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:01.700
were the switch from
oral to written music,

175
00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:07.760
which occurred during the Middle Ages, and
the switch from abstract music, chant,

176
00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:12.890
mass, motet, to memetic music
here again in the Renaissance.

177
00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:21.060
Music became a memetic language that we
all speak, or at least can all understand.

178
00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:23.640
Happy music,
well what are we gonna do with that?

179
00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:28.040
We're happy, we're gonna put it in major
and probably in an upper register.

180
00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:34.690
She falls down, struck down with grief.

181
00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:37.452
Well that's going to be slow in tempo.

182
00:13:37.452 --> 00:13:41.440
It's gonna be minor in key and
the music undoubtedly will go downward.

183
00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:45.020
These are sorts of gestures
that make up this language.

184
00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:49.407
In the next period in the history
of music, the Baroque period,

185
00:13:49.407 --> 00:13:54.280
this language of music which originated
in vocal music, will become so

186
00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:59.073
commonly understood that it can be
sounded by instruments alone, and

187
00:13:59.073 --> 00:14:00.963
we all will understand it.
