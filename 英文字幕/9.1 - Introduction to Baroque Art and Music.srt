00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.126
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:06.126 --> 00:00:08.810
Now we come to
the Baroque Period in music.

3
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:13.860
Though in truth, these period, these
time designators are somewhat arbitrary.

4
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.540
No composer ever slaps his forehead.

5
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.580
It's the year 1600.

6
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.580
Time for the Baroque style.

7
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.580
Or, it's 1750, time for the classical era.

8
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.980
Styles change gradually, and we,
historians, and people generally,

9
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.030
set convenient dates, so
that we can understand things.

10
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.230
We divide time into hours and minutes and
seconds just to make sense of it all.

11
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.020
Now with the Baroque period, we are lucky.

12
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.353
Because there's a rather clear
cut off provided by an event or

13
00:00:46.353 --> 00:00:49.613
development that happened around 1600.

14
00:00:49.613 --> 00:00:54.595
It comes conveniently in the form of
the creation of a new musical genre

15
00:00:54.595 --> 00:00:55.860
in the West.

16
00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.130
Opera, again, Italy around 1600.

17
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.360
Opera became so

18
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.830
important that we can use disappearances
to mark the beginning of the Baroque era.

19
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.787
Similarly, we have
a convenient end marker for

20
00:01:12.787 --> 00:01:16.804
the conclusion of this style of music,
1750.

21
00:01:16.804 --> 00:01:21.887
In fact, JS Bach did us a great
favor by dying in 1750.

22
00:01:21.887 --> 00:01:24.435
[LAUGH] Of course, I'm kidding,

23
00:01:24.435 --> 00:01:29.076
it'd be wonderful if I had even
more great music by Bach, but

24
00:01:29.076 --> 00:01:34.810
the fact that he died in 1750, and
musical style changed thereafter,

25
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.110
became very different,
is a convenient end marker for us.

26
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.777
So for the Baroque we have these two
convenient goal posts, 1600, 1750.

27
00:01:46.777 --> 00:01:52.432
It's a long span, and one that
incorporates many stylistic changes.

28
00:01:52.432 --> 00:01:58.092
Indeed in the arts and music, the Baroque
era is something of a disjunctive and

29
00:01:58.092 --> 00:02:01.370
highly variegated period of artistic time.

30
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.810
Where do we get the term Baroque?

31
00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.210
Well, it come from the Portuguese word,
barroco, pearl of irregular shape.

32
00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.920
At first, the term Baroque had
something of a pejorative sense,

33
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.850
meaning irregular, untamed,
perhaps even bizarre in style.

34
00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.030
Well if not, bizarre, at least flamboyant.

35
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.040
And it's also generally dramatic and
grandiose in scale.

36
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.450
To get a sense of this,
let's look at some slides.

37
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.362
Here we are again at St. Peters in Rome,

38
00:02:34.362 --> 00:02:38.787
constructed from roughly 1550 to 1650.

39
00:02:38.787 --> 00:02:41.880
Late renaissance, into the early baroque.

40
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.610
It's big.

41
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.370
The largest church in the world.

42
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.420
And we can get a sense of this
by turning the other way.

43
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.510
The Piasa can accommodate several
football or soccer fields.

44
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.330
Now going inside, on the left
side of the nave of the church,

45
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.570
the longest nave in the world in Christen.

46
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.050
On the right,
the canopy over the high alter.

47
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.600
It's huge, nine stories tall or
about 90 feet tall.

48
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.290
Designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini in 1626.

49
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:21.300
Now the flamboyant baroque, well it's
evident here in these monstrances

50
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.990
showing the radiation of
the transubstantiation of the Holy Spirit,

51
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.400
which is a typical image found
in Roman Baroque churches.

52
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.250
Here we have two.

53
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.660
Both designed again by Bernini.

54
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.420
One for Saint Peters, on the left, and

55
00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.730
the other for the Church of
Our Lady of Victory, also in Rome.

56
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.440
Also in the same church, Our Lady of
Victory, the famous Saint Teresa in agony,

57
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.300
which twists with Baroque energy.

58
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.240
And now, speaking of Bernini,

59
00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.540
let's do a comparison, it's instructed
I think to put the two together.

60
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.930
David by the young Michelangelo, and

61
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.180
David by Bernini,
a century later on the right.

62
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.080
What's your reaction to them?

63
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.106
Think about it for a minute.

64
00:04:14.986 --> 00:04:21.740
How do they exemplify the Renaissance
as opposed to Baroque statuary?

65
00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.660
Well on the left long straight lines,
balance and

66
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.110
proportion, versus on the right,
right angles and twists.

67
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.520
From the left placid smile.

68
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.670
On the right, a tense grimace.

69
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:39.470
Renaissance, Classical serenity
versus Baroque energy.

70
00:04:40.505 --> 00:04:44.290
Let's go back to that Roman
church of Our Lady of Victory and

71
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.420
let's look at the ceiling there
with the organ to the left.

72
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.770
Well, why is this not
Classical in any way?

73
00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:57.240
Well, because the ceiling is overrun
with activity, with ornamentation.

74
00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.350
There's scarcely a square inch here
that is not used in some active way.

75
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.760
It's all energy.

76
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.315
Now we turn to a comparison again.

77
00:05:07.315 --> 00:05:11.970
St. Peters on the left, St.
Florian in Austria.

78
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.640
Again, here it's not only ornament,
but power.

79
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.390
We see both energy and power.

80
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:23.070
These structures are large, but
they are also highly ornate.

81
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.500
There's a string vertical structure,
the pillars go up and support.

82
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.530
But on top it's all decoration and
ornamentation.

83
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.590
And that often happens in Baroque music.

84
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:41.950
Where we get a simple vertical support,
but also a highly ornate canopy

85
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.610
up above, or in musical case,
a highly ornate melody.

86
00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.710
Now let's review just a bit here,

87
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.460
what we're seeing on the screen at the
moment is a slide of a representation of

88
00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:01.450
most Renaissance religious music and
most song repertoire of the Renaissance.

89
00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.180
How it looked, in terms of texture.

90
00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.970
As you can see, it's highly imitated.

91
00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.650
Highly contrapuntal.

92
00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.490
Highly horizontal.

93
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.090
With independent lines.

94
00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:14.740
Now let's compare here.

95
00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.760
Here's what early baroque texture
is more likely to look like.

96
00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.480
More homophonic,
more block-like, more vertical.

97
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.410
As the image says, not all voices in
homophonic texture are created equally,

98
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.189
top and bottom are more important.

99
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:36.490
The bass in baroque music is strong,
and usually steady, as we'll see

100
00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:41.566
later on when we get to our segment
four with the baroque basso continuo.
