[MUSIC]

2
00:00:05.754 --> 00:00:10.004
As we said,
opera originated in Italy around 1600.

3
00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:13.270
Actually it's surprising
that it took that long.

4
00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.959
China and Japan had had opera
ever since the 13th century.

5
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.700
In the West, again in Italy,
opera rose as a new genre.

6
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.630
Ironically by trying to re-create an old
one, ancient Greek drama, Greek tragedy.

7
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:33.650
In a very real sense, the creation of
this genre, opera, was not something new.

8
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.810
But a continuation of
an older humanist agendum,

9
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.610
the need to recapture,
recreate the power of ancient Greek music.

10
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.400
And indeed the very subjects,
the plots of these early operas were based

11
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.880
on those of ancient Greek drama or
mythology or Roman history.

12
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.090
But what is opera?

13
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.570
Well of course a drama,
a play that is sung.

14
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.540
That's an odd thing to do, to sing a play.

15
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.120
Normal human discourse
is usually not sung.

16
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.610
We don't go around saying you took my
parking place, I'm very angry at you.

17
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.400
But in opera, we do.

18
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.740
Why?

19
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.900
Because with opera,

20
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.800
the assumption is that the drama is
powerful and that the music is powerful.

21
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.120
And if you could put the two together,
you'd have something very powerful.

22
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.339
Opera, in fact,
is greater than the sum of its parts.

23
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.450
In some ways,
opera is like a traditional Broadway show.

24
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.950
You have a sung play that is divided
into acts, usually two or three.

25
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.040
You have a book, in other words the text,
which is opera we call

26
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.590
the libretto, and you have the lyrics,
the poetic part of the libretto.

27
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.840
And you have the musical score that
adds emotional intensity to the drama.

28
00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.000
What happens first?

29
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.470
Well, an opera usually
begins with an overture,

30
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.270
an instrumental piece
that opens the opera.

31
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.280
It used to be that the overture was
played to call people to attention.

32
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.480
To tell them hey, pay attention.

33
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.830
Go take your seats.

34
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.143
Only later was it played after
the people were seated and

35
00:02:17.143 --> 00:02:19.810
people listened to the overture.

36
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.420
Let's see how this works.

37
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.160
To do so we go to northern Italy,
the birth place of opera.

38
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.490
Even today about three quarters of the
operas that are performed in opera houses

39
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.440
around thee world have been written
to an Italian text, perhaps, in part,

40
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.380
because of the regularly spaced
vowels in the Italian language.

41
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.337
Anyway, here's a map of the city-states
of Northern Italy around 1600.

42
00:02:46.337 --> 00:02:52.180
And you can see there in red Florence,
Mantua and Venice.

43
00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.650
The first opera of lasting
importance was composed here

44
00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.290
in Mantua by Claudio Monteverdi.

45
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.020
Now, Monteverdi's first
opera was entitled Orfeo.

46
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.780
And he wrote it, again, in Mantua in 1607.

47
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.510
Orfeo, or Orpheus,
was an appropriate subject because

48
00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.100
the story is drawn from
classical Greek mythology.

49
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.280
What's the story about?

50
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.288
Well, it tells the tale of Orfeo,
a half-god,

51
00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:30.360
half-man who has married a human,
Eurydice, but

52
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.560
she's been killed by a snake, and carried
off to Hades, the Greek vision of hell.

53
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.220
It's Orfeo's job to descent into Hades and
rescue her.

54
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.050
So, this, in a sense, is a rescue drama.

55
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.830
Here on the right, we see the scene.

56
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.760
Down below, we've got the River Styx,
Charon, the ferryman on the left and

57
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.254
or fail with his lyre to which
he sings on the right, and

58
00:03:56.254 --> 00:03:59.730
moribund Eurydice.

59
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.060
Well, let's watch a video
now of the first fully

60
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.000
formed opera starting with the overture.

61
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.510
The production here is by the Spanish
early music conductor Horace

62
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.620
who has done his best to recreate the
opera as close to Monteverdi's original

63
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.000
intentions as possible.

64
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.463
Here's the overture.

65
00:04:22.463 --> 00:04:32.463
[MUSIC]

66
00:04:56.962 --> 00:04:59.160
Okay I'm gong to pause it here just for
a second.

67
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.350
And you can see on the screen there
some of these baroque instruments.

68
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:04.960
We see a harp in the orchestra.

69
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.640
Normally we don't see that.

70
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.030
We see some violins.

71
00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.970
We see some strange looking woodwind
instruments that we'll talk about

72
00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.010
a little later on.

73
00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:17.390
And we see that giant
lute-like thing over there,

74
00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.380
to the right center, a theorbo.

75
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.110
So this is Monteverdi's
early baroque orchestra.

76
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.474
All right.
Let's go on and

77
00:05:25.474 --> 00:05:28.336
hear the rest of our overture to Orfeo.

78
00:05:28.336 --> 00:05:38.336
[MUSIC]

79
00:06:32.005 --> 00:06:34.242
As to the opera itself, well,

80
00:06:34.242 --> 00:06:39.588
let's first have an explanation of
the style of singing calling monody.

81
00:06:39.588 --> 00:06:45.740
Expressive one line monody solo singing
accompanied by a small ensemble.

82
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.780
Eventually, early monody would bifurcate
into two contrasting modes of delivery,

83
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.860
recitative and aria.

84
00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.380
What the difference between
a recitative and an aria?

85
00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:59.530
Well recitative generally told what
was going on, what's happening, and

86
00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:05.930
aria reflected what the protagonist,
the singer, felt about what was happening.

87
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:12.560
You can find almost all of
Monteverdi's Orfeo on YouTube.

88
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.820
But let's cut to the high point.

89
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:18.545
Let's go to the climactic aria
in which Orfeo tries to convince

90
00:07:18.545 --> 00:07:22.500
Charon to allow him to cross
the river Styx and into Hades.

91
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:29.560
But first, let's review the nature of
this particular aria by way of a slide.

92
00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.400
As you can see here,
the notes of the music

93
00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:40.060
pertain to the aria Posente Spirto,
powerful spirit.

94
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:45.330
And this is an aria in which we
have passionate, expansive, and

95
00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:51.990
tuneful expressions of the feelings and
motions of Orfeo.

96
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:54.610
It's accompanied by the full orchestra and

97
00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:58.583
by a basso continuo, which we'll
talk about a little bit later on.

98
00:07:58.583 --> 00:08:03.350
It's a self-contained unit,
both textually and musically, so

99
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:09.210
we've got a poem here set to music
which has its own meter and rhyme.

100
00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:13.530
And note the vocal embellishments
to convey emotion.

101
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:18.690
Orfeo wants to persuade us, and
he does so by means of ornamentation.

102
00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:20.629
Odd sorts of ornamentation,
where he might sing,

103
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:22.503
[MUSIC].

104
00:08:22.503 --> 00:08:26.751
Sounds strange,
sounds almost like a goat, but

105
00:08:26.751 --> 00:08:32.260
that is where Orfeo is trying
to be his most persuasive.

106
00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.680
All right.
Let's turn to the video now.

107
00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:38.213
And I might talk a bit as we go.

108
00:08:38.213 --> 00:08:46.879
>> [FOREIGN]

109
00:08:46.879 --> 00:08:48.464
>> Powerful spirit.

110
00:08:48.464 --> 00:08:58.464
[MUSIC]

111
00:09:07.671 --> 00:09:13.005
It is referring to the God Charon,
the guardian of Hades, or Hell.

112
00:09:13.005 --> 00:09:23.005
[MUSIC]

113
00:09:34.378 --> 00:09:36.504
So the music here is actually
coming from the pit.

114
00:09:36.504 --> 00:09:40.054
Those on stage are simply
holding symbols of the music.

115
00:09:40.054 --> 00:09:43.421
Indeed, Orfeo is holding
a symbol of the music, the lyre.

116
00:09:43.421 --> 00:09:53.421
[MUSIC]

117
00:10:11.379 --> 00:10:16.181
And the ornaments, or
imitation that you just heard again,

118
00:10:16.181 --> 00:10:20.984
are attempts on Orfeo's part to
persuade Charon to allow him

119
00:10:20.984 --> 00:10:24.320
to cross into Hades and rescue Eurydice.

120
00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.750
Music is the agent of the river.

121
00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:32.980
This is just a taste of Monteverdi's
Orfeo, and you can watch all of these

122
00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:36.960
scenes in more than one production
on YouTube, and compare them.

123
00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:41.450
But now we're going to move on
from early 17th century opera to

124
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:44.190
late 17th century opera.

125
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:49.160
And we'll see how monody has
progressively split further

126
00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:54.360
into these two distinctly different
styles, recitative and aria.

127
00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:59.414
For this, we'll go to England,

128
00:10:59.414 --> 00:11:03.566
specifically London, and

129
00:11:03.566 --> 00:11:10.797
to an opera by Henry Purcell,
Dido and Aeneas.
