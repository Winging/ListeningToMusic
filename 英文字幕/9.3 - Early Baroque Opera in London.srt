00:00:00.243 --> 00:00:10.243
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.080
Here we are in 17th Century London.

3
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.740
You can see there we've got the river
Thames, and then London Bridge,

4
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.630
the one bridge there in the 17th
century that went across the river.

5
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.470
To the right of the bridge
we see the Tower of London.

6
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:44.390
As we swing around to the left we can see
St. James park, over here to the left.

7
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.320
The king lived in this area, Whitehall
was down here and Westminster Abbey.

8
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.790
And then over here actually not

9
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.350
the map is where Buckingham Palace
will ultimately be built.

10
00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.360
And then farther off to my left
from there we come to Chelsea which

11
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.080
was in a suburb but's now
very much downtown London.

12
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.440
And Chelsea is an important
part about what

13
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.180
we are going to discuss here
with the opera of Henry Purcell.

14
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.330
So here,
you see an image of Henry Purcell.

15
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.780
He's one of the three greatest
composers in English history.

16
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.120
Purcell, Handel, and Paul Mc Cartney.

17
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.150
Well, at least those are my choices for
the three greatest English composers.

18
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.520
Purcell worked as an organist
at Westminster Abbey.

19
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.780
And is a composer and organist for the
King in the Chapel Royal, as they call it.

20
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.610
And he had an interest in theater music,
London being,

21
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.410
ever since Shakespeare's day,
the world's greatest theater town.

22
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.670
Purcell's most enduring opera, Dido and

23
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.760
Aeneas, was one of the first
written in English.

24
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.530
It was actually composed not for
a commercial theatre but

25
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.800
for a girl's boarding school or
finishing school in Chelsea.

26
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.390
The opera functions something came to
a senior class play because all the parts,

27
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.120
except one, were written for girls.

28
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.810
These girls had surely studied Virgil's
and Nyid in their Latin classes.

29
00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.550
It was standard Latin to be memorized.

30
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.810
And Purcell fashion and
opera libretto out of Virgil's poetry.

31
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.220
The story, as you may know,
is about Aeneas and the Trojan Wars and

32
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.370
his flight from Troy.

33
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.810
Stopping by Carthage,
capturing the heart of Queen Dido, and

34
00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.910
then abandoning her to go on and
found the city of Rome.

35
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:40.970
Alone, broken-hearted, noble Queen Dido
sings her last, and then expires.

36
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.110
Stabs herself with a sword, or
burns herself on a funeral pyre,

37
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.260
or dies of a broken heart in the opera.

38
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.090
Whatever.

39
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.560
As my colleague Tim Rhode has
famously said her despair,

40
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.549
her despondency is poison enough.

41
00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.200
The scene of Dido's death,
which we will study here,

42
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.570
is divided into Dido's recitative and
her aria.

43
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.090
Here's the music of her recitative.

44
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:15.400
So here with the recitative
the music slides down chromatically.

45
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:25.400
[MUSIC]

46
00:03:44.413 --> 00:03:48.270
So as you heard,
the music is sliding down there.

47
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.670
Chromatic scale,
a descending chromatic scale is used.

48
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.070
Chromaticism in music signals tension and
pain.

49
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.750
Here, the music descends.

50
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:56.770
Which symbolizes or

51
00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.460
expresses defeat and resignation,
Dido's defeat and resignation.

52
00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.560
People die down, they don't die up.

53
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.220
Downwards equals resignation in life and
in music.

54
00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.660
Then comes the aria.

55
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.945
It's written on an ostinato,
a repeating bass.

56
00:04:15.945 --> 00:04:21.250
The English word for
this is a ground bass.

57
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.180
A repeating or foundational,
a grounding bass.

58
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.615
Let me play the,
just the bass on the keyboard here.

59
00:04:28.615 --> 00:04:37.541
[MUSIC]

60
00:04:37.541 --> 00:04:40.500
Okay, so that's the five measure bass.

61
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.671
It has a chromatic descent.

62
00:04:41.671 --> 00:04:43.840
[MUSIC]

63
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.557
Again, more pang, and
then a sort of looping around.

64
00:04:46.557 --> 00:04:50.561
[MUSIC]

65
00:04:50.561 --> 00:04:54.005
To end the five bar phrase.

66
00:04:54.005 --> 00:04:58.301
And then up above this,
Purcell writes a beautiful aria that we

67
00:04:58.301 --> 00:05:02.609
will hear that proceeds with
consonance and dissonance.

68
00:05:02.609 --> 00:05:10.339
[MUSIC]

69
00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:11.639
Now looping back.

70
00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:16.626
[MUSIC]

71
00:05:16.626 --> 00:05:19.771
And there we are.

72
00:05:19.771 --> 00:05:23.481
So, now we're going to
watch a video of this,

73
00:05:23.481 --> 00:05:30.252
stopping along the way to discuss things
such as basso ostinato and basso continuo.

74
00:05:30.252 --> 00:05:31.143
[MUSIC]

75
00:05:31.143 --> 00:05:34.976
[INAUDIBLE] Okay, here we go.

76
00:05:34.976 --> 00:05:40.664
With the recivity,
with Dido singing to her servant.

77
00:05:40.664 --> 00:05:49.916
[MUSIC]

78
00:05:49.916 --> 00:05:51.430
Still falling down here.

79
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:52.938
About half way down.

80
00:05:52.938 --> 00:06:02.938
[MUSIC]

81
00:06:13.944 --> 00:06:17.790
Okay, recitative, just been
accompanied by a string instrument.

82
00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.076
Now another string
instrument starts out here.

83
00:06:20.076 --> 00:06:22.588
[MUSIC]

84
00:06:22.588 --> 00:06:26.790
Here's our basso ostinato, or ground bass.

85
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.980
Just with a low string instrument.

86
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.080
Accompaniment comes in with the voice.

87
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.332
Orchestra comes in.

88
00:06:36.332 --> 00:06:46.332
[MUSIC]

89
00:06:48.874 --> 00:06:52.020
Here the loops back and
starts all over again.

90
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:59.591
[MUSIC]

91
00:06:59.591 --> 00:07:01.576
Base descending chromatically.

92
00:07:01.576 --> 00:07:08.693
[MUSIC]

93
00:07:08.693 --> 00:07:12.114
Looping back to the tonic.

94
00:07:12.114 --> 00:07:14.710
Repeat of the text.

95
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:20.300
Repeat of the melody.

96
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.215
Aria repeat texts.

97
00:07:22.215 --> 00:07:25.197
Recitative don't repeat text.

98
00:07:25.197 --> 00:07:30.769
[MUSIC]

99
00:07:30.769 --> 00:07:33.155
>> Now, heads up on the word create.

100
00:07:33.155 --> 00:07:36.138
You can hear ornamentation
provided by the singer.

101
00:07:36.138 --> 00:07:37.972
[MUSIC]

102
00:07:37.972 --> 00:07:39.575
Hear how she filled in that interval?

103
00:07:39.575 --> 00:07:40.712
Here she'll do it again.

104
00:07:40.712 --> 00:07:48.710
[MUSIC]

105
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:51.246
And the ostinato as it loops back.

106
00:07:51.246 --> 00:07:53.930
And on the [INAUDIBLE].

107
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:55.690
So we're going to pause it here.

108
00:07:55.690 --> 00:08:03.510
Well that's just one
interpretation of this aria.

109
00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:07.870
But we're going to go on now to
a comparison of two other, two very

110
00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:13.070
different approaches to one and the same
aria taken by two different singers.

111
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:19.620
Music is communication from creator
to listener with the performer

112
00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:24.740
as something of a middle man, or in this
case, a middle woman, an intermediary.

113
00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:29.090
But the intermediary in
delivering the message can do so

114
00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:32.650
in very different ways, as we'll here.

115
00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:34.200
So let's compare singers here.

116
00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.080
Let's compare intermediaries.

117
00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.410
We'll start with the early
music specialist.

118
00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:44.460
She's not a modern opera star, but
a specialist in early music, Emma Kirkby.

119
00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:47.680
As you listen, think about three things.

120
00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.240
What's the nature of
the singer's voice here?

121
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.530
How much vibrato does she use?

122
00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:56.170
How much vibrato is there
in here mode of singing?

123
00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.360
Second what's the tempo?

124
00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.480
Conduct along with the music.

125
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:05.100
It's in three and you'll get a sense of
the, of the tempo if you, if you conduct.

126
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:10.740
And three, how powerful is the orchestra?

127
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:15.710
Does it seem like a small, early music
orchestra of the baroque period?

128
00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:17.256
Or a large, modern symphony?

129
00:09:17.256 --> 00:09:20.170
So here's your challenge.

130
00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:22.120
Answer those three questions.

131
00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:22.790
Here we go.

132
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:25.658
We're starting with Emma Kirkby.

133
00:09:25.658 --> 00:09:35.658
[MUSIC]

134
00:09:46.693 --> 00:09:56.016
One, two, three, one, two,
three, one, two, three.

135
00:09:56.016 --> 00:10:06.016
[MUSIC]

136
00:10:20.835 --> 00:10:22.960
All right, let's pause it here.

137
00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:27.950
We're going to go on now to the reporting
of opera star Jesse Norman.

138
00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:29.870
And again the same three questions.

139
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:31.560
What's the nature of the singer's voice?

140
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.160
How much vibrato does it have?

141
00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.160
What's the tempo?

142
00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.000
Conduct along with the music.

143
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.130
And three, how powerful is the orchestra?

144
00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:43.372
Does it seem like a small, early musical
orchestra, or a large, modern one?

145
00:10:43.372 --> 00:10:45.518
Let's listen to Jesse Norman now.

146
00:10:45.518 --> 00:10:55.518
[MUSIC]

147
00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:35.211
So let's pause it here.

148
00:12:35.211 --> 00:12:36.187
[MUSIC]

149
00:12:36.187 --> 00:12:39.186
Well, what'd you think
about these two recordings,

150
00:12:39.186 --> 00:12:41.020
the difference between the two?

151
00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:43.260
I'd like to know, so go online please and

152
00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.570
take an interactive quiz
responding to the questions posed.

153
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:52.020
You can also answer specific
musical questions, and

154
00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:55.710
you can tell me which
recording you preferred.

155
00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:56.210
And why?

156
00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:06.231
Again, two very different interpretations

157
00:13:06.231 --> 00:13:13.040
of one in the same

158
00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:19.359
beautiful aria

159
00:13:19.359 --> 00:13:26.163
by Henry Purcell.
