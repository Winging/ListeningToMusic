[MUSIC]

2
00:00:10.504 --> 00:00:15.247
So far in our discussion of Baroque music
we've talked about opera and voices,

3
00:00:15.247 --> 00:00:17.125
now its time for instruments.

4
00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:21.830
Let's start with a melody and base, and
this brings us to the two instruments

5
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.870
that dominated Baroque instrumental sound,
the violin and the harpsichord.

6
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.260
The violin to the melody.

7
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.460
Harpsichord, for the bass and harmony.

8
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.280
And we'll throw in another bass
harmony type instrument, the theorbo.

9
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.110
Now let's start with the violin.

10
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.920
Actually the term violin is diminutive.

11
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:50.730
Little viol, violino, violino; but as the
violin is the little viol, what's a viol?

12
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.370
Well, it's an early six string instrument.

13
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.429
Or in some cases, here as you see on the
screen to the left, even a seven string

14
00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:02.004
instrument that prevailed in Western
Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries.

15
00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:07.010
It was also fretted like
the guitar of today.

16
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.378
In the mid 16th century,
there arose a small cousin of the viol.

17
00:01:12.378 --> 00:01:15.570
Violin, or little viol.

18
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.730
You can see the difference,
comparing left and right.

19
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.380
Only four strings to the right,
and no frets.

20
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.400
And it has sounding holes in
the shape of an F rather than a C,

21
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.580
which makes a slight
difference acoustically.

22
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.890
The violin was originally a low class
tavern instrument, played by dancing

23
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.670
masters, dancing teachers,
to entertain with dances in taverns and

24
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.330
in public houses, bars and effect.

25
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.450
Looking at this map we see that
the center of violin construction

26
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.580
was then in Northern Italy,
specifically in Cremona.

27
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.660
And that's where the center of
violin making is still today,

28
00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.930
in Cremona, to the left there,
to the west of Mantua.

29
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.180
And here we see a woman in
one of these many small shops

30
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.900
that you can visit in Cremona.

31
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.230
Now, there's one thing
that's always surprised me.

32
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:12.590
Yes, violins are made of maple and spruce.

33
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.750
That much I knew, but
all violins seem to look

34
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.820
remarkably similar in size and
shape and general design.

35
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.130
They're all pretty much alike,
pretty much identical.

36
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.560
Here we see violins from different
times and different places.

37
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.490
One from 17th century Italy,
18th century Germany,

38
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.130
20th century Germany, but
they're all identical.

39
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.360
How did they do that?

40
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.280
How do they do that?

41
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.890
Well, let's see, this way.

42
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.130
They do it with a mold or a a frame.

43
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.016
There was a standard mold that
every Luthier, in other words,

44
00:02:46.016 --> 00:02:52.390
instrument maker, had and passed along
that led to this standard size and shape.

45
00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:00.560
All right, so the violin is the primary
melody carrying instrument of the Boroque.

46
00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.910
But what about the bass and the harmony?

47
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.320
Well at first,
that was provided by a large,

48
00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.719
loot like instrument called the theorbo,
and then by the harpsichord.

49
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.490
For demonstration of both of these,
let's go back to my colleague and

50
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.200
professional early music performer
extraordinaire, Grant Herod.

51
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.108
>> So here we are back again with my
friend and colleague, Grant Herod, and

52
00:03:25.108 --> 00:03:28.360
we're going to be talking today
about baroque instruments and

53
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.540
baroque orchestras.

54
00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.704
But first, the baroque instruments.

55
00:03:31.704 --> 00:03:36.580
We left off last time, we're gonna show
this slide now, we left off last time with

56
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.905
a slide coming from the National Gallery
in London of a lute.

57
00:03:41.905 --> 00:03:46.805
And then we're going to turn to the next
slide which actually comes from

58
00:03:46.805 --> 00:03:52.815
an American collection out in Columbus,
Ohio, an art museum there,

59
00:03:52.815 --> 00:03:55.885
showing this instrument called,
oh what is this thing called?

60
00:03:55.885 --> 00:03:57.705
>> This is the theorbo.

61
00:03:57.705 --> 00:04:05.730
And it's a kind of a bass lute, from about
here to the end of the peg box here.

62
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.462
It's just a large loot,
bass loot, and the strings

63
00:04:09.462 --> 00:04:13.129
[MUSIC]

64
00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:16.500
are tuned like a loot
except it's too long.

65
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.615
So the top two strings

66
00:04:17.615 --> 00:04:19.962
[MUSIC]

67
00:04:19.962 --> 00:04:22.220
are tuned down an octave
from the loot tuning.

68
00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:28.470
So the highest sounding string is
the third string from the edge there

69
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:35.982
which gives it a peculiar technique and
a very bassy or tenor-like range.

70
00:04:35.982 --> 00:04:40.951
Then we have an extension neck
set on it that accommodates

71
00:04:40.951 --> 00:04:43.337
these seven bass strings.

72
00:04:43.337 --> 00:04:49.750
[MUSIC]

73
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.260
Tune to some sort of a scale usually.

74
00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.260
>> Mm.

75
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.781
>> And this was an attempt
to give the lute a little

76
00:04:58.781 --> 00:05:03.879
more volume, a bigger range obviously and

77
00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:07.713
more of a base presence so that.

78
00:05:07.713 --> 00:05:14.504
[MUSIC]

79
00:05:14.504 --> 00:05:19.040
The lute was just more suited to
play the music of this early baroque

80
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.710
period that featured the baseline
more than renaissance music.

81
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.400
>> Yeah, that's a very important
observation, because we have been talking

82
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.360
about and will be talking more about
this whole idea of the basso continuo.

83
00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.170
Well, this instrument could really by
itself provide all of the bass and

84
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.030
the harmony.

85
00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:39.040
In an odd way,

86
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.970
it's like a piano in a jazz band today
except it's a lot more portable.

87
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.230
Or like a harpsichord would
have been in the early Baroque.

88
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.570
Except again, it's a lot more portable.

89
00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:54.004
Strum a chord or two more just to
show them the sound of that bass.

90
00:05:54.004 --> 00:06:04.004
[MUSIC]

91
00:06:09.754 --> 00:06:14.133
Beautiful, beautiful sound, and
one of the things it would do,

92
00:06:14.133 --> 00:06:17.875
of course,
is play something called the figured bass,

93
00:06:17.875 --> 00:06:22.672
and you will see a slide a little bit
later on showing you how this works.

94
00:06:22.672 --> 00:06:26.769
But maybe you could give us
a demonstration whereby you the performer,

95
00:06:26.769 --> 00:06:29.568
Grant, have just a bassline and
some numbers and

96
00:06:29.568 --> 00:06:33.000
you're supposed to know how to
flesh out a chord from that.

97
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.970
>> Right.
>> So can you play a bass line?

98
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.879
>> Yeah, so
a simple bass line might sound like this.

99
00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:48.296
[MUSIC]

100
00:06:48.296 --> 00:06:52.753
I harmonize that bass line according
to the numbers in the figured bass.

101
00:06:52.753 --> 00:07:02.753
[MUSIC]

102
00:07:08.962 --> 00:07:10.921
So it's almost like an entire orchestra.

103
00:07:10.921 --> 00:07:16.210
Sound big booming and it could very
well support a baroque singer.

104
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.910
Now let me formally introduce two terms.

105
00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:26.780
Basso continuo, continuous bass,
and figured bass.

106
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:33.520
A basso continuo is the Baroque term for
a strong bass and chordal accompaniment.

107
00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.370
Created by, usually by a stringed
instrument, such as the cello, and

108
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:43.850
by a chording instrument,
such as the theorbo, that we'll see again.

109
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:50.556
We just saw, or perhaps the harpsichord,
or sometimes even the organ.

110
00:07:50.556 --> 00:07:54.572
And this string instrument plus
the chording instrument play throughout

111
00:07:54.572 --> 00:07:55.226
the piece.

112
00:07:55.226 --> 00:07:56.477
That's why it's a continuate.

113
00:07:56.477 --> 00:07:59.804
Plays continually,
a strong continual bass.

114
00:07:59.804 --> 00:08:01.888
The string plays the bass line and

115
00:08:01.888 --> 00:08:06.810
the chording instrument flushes
out a rock solid harmony above it.

116
00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:11.300
Here's an all female quartet from the 18th
century in which the melody is played

117
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:16.740
by flute and violin and the basso
continuo by harpsichord and cello.

118
00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:20.619
Let's review and go on to figured bass.

119
00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:26.850
So, looking at the slide to review Basso
continuo a small ensemble of at least two

120
00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:31.230
instruments which provide a foundation for
the melody heard above and

121
00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:33.620
played continually throughout the piece.

122
00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:38.104
Okay now figured bass,
well figured bass is a numerical

123
00:08:38.104 --> 00:08:45.120
shorthand placed below the base line

124
00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:51.550
that an experienced musician
who's studied music theory and

125
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:56.430
knows how to play the keyboard will be
able to look at these numbers associated

126
00:08:56.430 --> 00:09:01.550
with the bass line and
fill out a chordal accompaniment with it.

127
00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:06.530
So, let me see if I can generate this for
you on the keyboard.

128
00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:07.780
Here's the bass line.

129
00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:15.639
[MUSIC]

130
00:09:15.639 --> 00:09:18.680
And an experienced musician
would flush it out this way.

131
00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:27.271
[MUSIC]

132
00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:32.920
Like that and here's an example of
an early keyboard piece by J.S.

133
00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:36.000
Bach with a figured bass.

134
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.230
I'll play the bass and
then I'll realize it for you here again.

135
00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:45.660
In our studio let me get
the music here is what wrote just

136
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:50.522
the bass line you have both
the above the realization below.

137
00:09:50.522 --> 00:10:00.088
[MUSIC]

138
00:10:00.088 --> 00:10:04.488
Okay now here's what Bach
wanted to have performed.

139
00:10:04.488 --> 00:10:14.488
[MUSIC]

140
00:10:21.065 --> 00:10:26.241
All right let's go on now to talk
about the workhorse of the baroque,

141
00:10:26.241 --> 00:10:31.850
the harpsichord and we'll begin
with a few introductory slides.

142
00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:36.310
Here's a typical harpsichord of the early
baroque with just one keyboard.

143
00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:40.270
Much later, much bigger harps accord.

144
00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:45.330
This one is about 1750 I believe,
with two manuals and three registers.

145
00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.320
By registers I mean sets of strings.

146
00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:52.750
Now here's a modern reproduction
of the Harps accord at Yale.

147
00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:57.630
Two keyboards,
two long sets of strings called eight

148
00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:02.960
foot strings and one set of short strings,
called four foot strings.

149
00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:09.410
So, you can sound one pitch by plucking
one of the three strings or you

150
00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:15.970
can sound two pitches by plucking, you can
sound two strings and get the same pitch.

151
00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:22.000
Sort of double down or double up or
you can bring three strings into play and

152
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.010
sort of get a trifecta here
a wammie of three strings all

153
00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:30.800
playing at once, but
no matter how many strings are playing,

154
00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:34.300
they're all plucked by
the same thing called a jack.

155
00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:36.500
Let's take a look at the jacks now.

156
00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:43.710
So, here we see the jacks on
an actual harpsichord, to the right

157
00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:49.810
and a diagram of how the jack works.

158
00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:53.030
As you can see, you press the key,
a fulcrum goes up, and

159
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:55.870
drives the jack up and up.

160
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:58.790
As the jacks go up,
they pluck the strings.

161
00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:01.320
Now, to make some sense out of this,

162
00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:05.460
we'll go to another
explanation from Grant Harrid.

163
00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:06.420
Well welcome back.

164
00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:08.010
Now we're gonna talk
about the harpsichord.

165
00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:11.760
Harpsichord was the workhorse
of the baroque era.

166
00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:16.340
It was the literally the basis
of virtually all music that was

167
00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:20.250
made from roughly 1650 up to 17 50,
17, 70, or

168
00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:24.760
so, and we're going to turn
once again to Grant Herod.

169
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.490
Just when you thought that Grant had

170
00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:31.720
demonstrated everything possible to
demonstrate by way of musical instruments,

171
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.610
yet, here is Grant again
demonstrating another instrument.

172
00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:36.340
This time, the harpsichord.

173
00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:40.290
>> Just to explain a few things about
this 18th century style harpsichord and

174
00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:42.600
some of the bells and whistles it has.

175
00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:47.400
First of all, of course the sound of
a harpsichord with its metal strings

176
00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:52.350
is created by a bit of
a feather plucking the string.

177
00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:58.340
The feather is attached to a jack and

178
00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:01.150
under this jack rail
are the rows of jacks.

179
00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:05.070
Three rows for the three different
registers of this harpsichord.

180
00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:09.010
As I pluck the string or press the key,

181
00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:14.205
it sends the jack up and the little
tangent plucks the string on its way up.

182
00:13:14.205 --> 00:13:18.599
[SOUND] The jack rail is
in place to make sure

183
00:13:18.599 --> 00:13:23.255
that they don't jump out of their sockets.

184
00:13:23.255 --> 00:13:25.124
>> [INAUDIBLE] on the way back down?

185
00:13:25.124 --> 00:13:28.718
>> There's a system of,
if it's slightly weighted so

186
00:13:28.718 --> 00:13:32.150
that on its way back down
it rocks slightly away and

187
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:36.910
the tension actually doesn't
come in contact with the string.

188
00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:39.931
Very sophisticated but

189
00:13:39.931 --> 00:13:45.220
sort of simple mechanism and
I can [SOUND].

190
00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:47.276
Play the upper keyboard as well.

191
00:13:47.276 --> 00:13:52.092
You notice the different
jack is activated.

192
00:13:52.092 --> 00:13:55.459
[MUSIC]

193
00:13:55.459 --> 00:13:59.894
>> So, there are three jacks then for
each pitch?

194
00:13:59.894 --> 00:14:03.363
Or is that-
>> Each key, yes and each pitch because I

195
00:14:03.363 --> 00:14:08.494
can also add a little, the shorter
set of strings that are sounding at

196
00:14:08.494 --> 00:14:13.558
four foot pitch rather than eight
foot pitch, so an octave higher.

197
00:14:13.558 --> 00:14:18.318
[MUSIC]

198
00:14:18.318 --> 00:14:21.557
I can get a contrast
between the upper keyboard

199
00:14:21.557 --> 00:14:24.633
[MUSIC]

200
00:14:24.633 --> 00:14:28.886
Which because it's plucking
the string a little closer to

201
00:14:28.886 --> 00:14:31.679
the bridge is slightly more brittle.

202
00:14:31.679 --> 00:14:42.417
[MUSIC]

203
00:14:42.417 --> 00:14:45.471
And of course,
the two keyboards can be coupled together.

204
00:14:45.471 --> 00:14:49.069
[MUSIC]

205
00:14:49.069 --> 00:14:53.237
And adding the back in,
we have the whole sound.

206
00:14:53.237 --> 00:14:57.010
[MUSIC]

207
00:14:57.010 --> 00:15:00.016
A sort of orchestral
sound of the harpsichord.

208
00:15:00.016 --> 00:15:06.037
>> So, just to review, we actually have
three sets of strings on this instrument?.

209
00:15:06.037 --> 00:15:09.110
>> Yes,
two at what we call eight foot pitch and

210
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:13.289
then one set of strings at four
foot pitch, an octave higher.

211
00:15:13.289 --> 00:15:16.045
>> Obviously as Grant just said,
an octave higher,

212
00:15:16.045 --> 00:15:19.585
and we have two keyboards so
how does that work?

213
00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:25.085
One keyboard plays two sets of strings
has the capacity to play two at one time?

214
00:15:25.085 --> 00:15:26.708
>> The lower keyboard can play the

215
00:15:26.708 --> 00:15:27.428
[MUSIC]

216
00:15:27.428 --> 00:15:30.931
one of the eight foot sets of strings or

217
00:15:30.931 --> 00:15:35.866
registers and, again,
we can engage the forefoot.

218
00:15:35.866 --> 00:15:37.805
[MUSIC]

219
00:15:37.805 --> 00:15:39.546
So, we have octave sounding there.

220
00:15:39.546 --> 00:15:43.726
That's on the lower keyboard and then
the upper keyboard can play by itself.

221
00:15:43.726 --> 00:15:45.557
[MUSIC]

222
00:15:45.557 --> 00:15:49.519
With a slightly more brittle sound or
if they're joined together,

223
00:15:49.519 --> 00:15:54.259
just by playing the lower keyboard I can
engage both of the eight foot registers.

224
00:15:54.259 --> 00:15:59.266
[MUSIC]

225
00:15:59.266 --> 00:16:03.300
So quite a variety in a single instrument.

226
00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:07.750
>> So, one hears that the reason that
the harpsichord fell by the wayside

227
00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:12.670
around 1750 to 1770, is that it had no
capacity for the gradation of sound.

228
00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:14.270
And in some ways, that's true.

229
00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:18.668
If you punch hard, [SOUND] okay.

230
00:16:18.668 --> 00:16:22.237
And now play very softly,
push very softly.

231
00:16:22.237 --> 00:16:27.086
[SOUND] The same volume sound,
basically the same volume sound.

232
00:16:27.086 --> 00:16:28.540
>> Basically yes.
>> Because it doesn't,

233
00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:34.240
the impact of the plucking,
the force of it in no way

234
00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:39.255
impacts the volume that's generated
from that particular string.

235
00:16:39.255 --> 00:16:43.890
So what you can't do, what's difficult
to do is to shape a phrase in a way on

236
00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:49.180
a harpsichord quite the way you can on
a piano with little gradations of loud and

237
00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:52.030
soft going up and back.

238
00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:53.400
Could I take it for a test drive here?

239
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:59.098
So start me out here, you be my
instructor, let's say I want to play

240
00:16:59.098 --> 00:17:04.308
something baroque that's very soft and
light, this thing [SOUND] of Bach.

241
00:17:04.308 --> 00:17:08.905
Now that sounds awfully loud, so how could
I back that down to maybe just the four?

242
00:17:08.905 --> 00:17:15.510
I've played on this keyboard here and
you disengage some of the eights, or.

243
00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:17.697
>> We can take the eight off here and

244
00:17:17.697 --> 00:17:21.029
that will leave you with
just the four foot here.

245
00:17:21.029 --> 00:17:22.586
[MUSIC]

246
00:17:22.586 --> 00:17:25.982
let me disengage this keyboard as well,
by pulling that out, and

247
00:17:25.982 --> 00:17:27.786
that should just be the four foot.

248
00:17:27.786 --> 00:17:29.446
[MUSIC]

249
00:17:29.446 --> 00:17:30.440
>> Wow.

250
00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:35.440
That is very quiet, all right so
let's build up our sound now.

251
00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.460
So that's just the four.

252
00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:40.855
>> If we add an eight foot to that,
we'd get this sound.

253
00:17:40.855 --> 00:17:42.940
>> Let's see.

254
00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:52.940
[MUSIC]

255
00:17:53.979 --> 00:17:55.653
And then by the big band sound.

256
00:17:55.653 --> 00:17:58.694
>> Right, engaging the other set of eight.

257
00:17:58.694 --> 00:18:00.958
[MUSIC]

258
00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:01.539
>> So it is a little bit bigger.

259
00:18:01.539 --> 00:18:05.253
[MUSIC]

260
00:18:05.253 --> 00:18:06.635
I bet it sounds good with some.

261
00:18:06.635 --> 00:18:17.118
[MUSIC]

262
00:18:17.118 --> 00:18:21.511
The Pachelbel bass that we're going
to explore in another segment.

263
00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:28.060
So as we saw, the harpsichord
has some capacity to increase or

264
00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:33.000
diminish the sound according to
how many registers of strings,

265
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.310
one, two, or three, are brought into play.

266
00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:40.310
But no matter how hard
you strike any one key,

267
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:44.420
you're always gonna get the same
volume with the harpsichord.

268
00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:50.230
And that limitation of volume and
inability to shape a phrase by

269
00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:54.900
means of volume was the liability of the
harpsichord and gradually the harpsichord

270
00:18:54.900 --> 00:19:00.070
gave way to the pianoforte or as we
call it today, gave way to the piano.

271
00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:03.660
Around 1770 the piano
replaced the harpsichord

272
00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:07.220
because of the sound
limitations of the harpsichord.

273
00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:11.130
So, to sum up this segment.

274
00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:15.430
In the Baroque era, the violin became
the principal carrier of the melody,

275
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:19.880
and the harpsichord the principle
setter of the harmony.

276
00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:25.470
But how did the full orchestra,
the orchestra of today, come into be?

277
00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:30.900
Well, we can demonstrate this quickly
by looking first at this slide.

278
00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:35.841
In the early Baroque period or
up to around the mid 17th century

279
00:19:35.841 --> 00:19:40.050
the core of the orchestra
was in effect all-strings,

280
00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:44.259
soprano, alto, and bass or
violin, second violin,

281
00:19:44.259 --> 00:19:49.040
viola, and cello,
with the double bass doubling the cello.

282
00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:50.610
That's why it's called a double bass.

283
00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:56.664
And of course we could have also with this
group the or a harpsichord or an organ.

284
00:19:56.664 --> 00:19:59.395
We would need those instruments as well.

285
00:19:59.395 --> 00:20:01.750
Now, let's take a look at a larger group.

286
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:04.525
To this initial core that we just saw,

287
00:20:04.525 --> 00:20:08.960
were gradually added woodwinds,
oboe and bassoons.

288
00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.110
First doubling the strings.

289
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:12.240
In other words, the oboes and

290
00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:17.060
the bassoons just doubled what the violins
were doing, violins and lower strings.

291
00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:21.510
And then they were given, the oboes and
violins, their own independent parts.

292
00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:28.260
And the horns were gradually
added to sustain the sound.

293
00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:31.910
We began to call them French
horns in the 19th century.

294
00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:36.640
So, the late 17th as the horns were
added to sustain the sound, and

295
00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:43.600
then also late 17th century trumpets and
drums added for brilliance when needed.

296
00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:50.780
So, by around 1700, the late Baroque
orchestra was in play, in place.

297
00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:56.235
And it gave us the symphony
orchestra of today.
