[MUSIC]

2
00:00:13.135 --> 00:00:14.414
Welcome back.

3
00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:17.903
We've talked about the instruments
that led the charge and

4
00:00:17.903 --> 00:00:21.120
in fact led the change in baroque music.

5
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.480
Let's now focus on some pieces.

6
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.930
I've chosen two that you'll
likely know very well.

7
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:33.130
The Cannon by Johann Pachelbel and
The Spring Concerto of Antonio Vivaldi.

8
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.220
Let's start with the Pachelbel.

9
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.120
Second only to the bass line

10
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.190
of the blues the most famous bass line
of all is that of the Pachelbel canon.

11
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.080
Like the blues bass, it's another ostinato
bass, a bass that repeats over and over.

12
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.460
Well who was Johann Pachelbel?

13
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.470
He was an organist and

14
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.730
composer in south central Germany
at the end of the 17th century.

15
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.360
Johann Christoph Bach was
a pupil of Pachelbel.

16
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.020
And when young Johann Sebastian Bach's
parents died and left him an orphan at

17
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.930
about the age of ten, eldest brother
Johann Christoph became his guardian.

18
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.569
So there is a Pachelbel-Bach connection.

19
00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:22.957
Anyway, Pachelbel composed
an instrumental Canon in D Major.

20
00:01:22.957 --> 00:01:28.336
And here you see the music of
it we have the famous bass

21
00:01:28.336 --> 00:01:33.347
line it's a underneath
of eight pitches and

22
00:01:33.347 --> 00:01:39.581
above those eight pitches
a harmony is constructed fleshing

23
00:01:39.581 --> 00:01:46.691
out the figured bass producing
the basso continuo here's the bass.

24
00:01:46.691 --> 00:01:53.917
[MUSIC]

25
00:01:53.917 --> 00:01:56.516
And then here's how the keyboard
player would realize that.

26
00:01:56.516 --> 00:02:07.443
[MUSIC]

27
00:02:07.443 --> 00:02:10.888
So that's the basso continuo
playing throughout the piece and

28
00:02:10.888 --> 00:02:15.340
basso, basso ostinato starting over and
over again, going 28 times.

29
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.880
The odd thing is with the Pachelbel Canon,
the odd thing is we don't hear the canon.

30
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.334
Let me play just a little
bit of the canonic line.

31
00:02:25.334 --> 00:02:29.625
[MUSIC]

32
00:02:29.625 --> 00:02:31.410
And then another part comes in.

33
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.390
So we have a three part canon or
a three part round.

34
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.140
But we don't hear it.

35
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.130
Why don't hear it?

36
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.310
At least we don't hear it literally.

37
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.990
We don't hear it because
Pachelbel has orchestrated this

38
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.940
with all instruments
being played by a violin.

39
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.660
So there's no separation by color here,
there's no separation by timbre.

40
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.470
And they're all in the same range, so

41
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.990
there's no separation by range or
frequency.

42
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.310
But here is a video of
the Pachelbel Canon, created by,

43
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.590
actually by my friend Stephen Malinowski
out in Richmond California.

44
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.520
And we're going to play this.

45
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.968
Let's start it up here now.

46
00:03:11.968 --> 00:03:14.663
[MUSIC]

47
00:03:14.663 --> 00:03:16.325
Good.

48
00:03:16.325 --> 00:03:20.459
So we have the basso continuo,
basso starting out.

49
00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.162
And here comes the first violin,
it's right down the scale.

50
00:03:24.162 --> 00:03:29.178
[MUSIC]

51
00:03:29.178 --> 00:03:32.254
Second violin just duplicating
what the first had done.

52
00:03:32.254 --> 00:03:39.915
[MUSIC]

53
00:03:39.915 --> 00:03:41.788
Third violin come in.

54
00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:48.460
And the first violins now playing quarter
notes, dividing the half note into two.

55
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.970
Second violin picks up
those quarter notes.

56
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.053
It's a little bit complicated.

57
00:03:53.053 --> 00:03:56.594
What we hear is that ostinato
bass chugging underneath.

58
00:03:56.594 --> 00:03:58.889
[MUSIC]

59
00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:02.030
It's hard to know that we've got around
in here, it sounds like the music.

60
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.730
Now the first violin is
leading out with eighth notes.

61
00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.810
Second violin picks that up, gives
the sense that the piece is going faster.

62
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.210
There's more activity.

63
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.270
It's actually not going faster.

64
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.650
The tempo is exactly the same,
the tempo is rigid.

65
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.700
But psychologically,
we perceive this as motion.

66
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:21.325
[MUSIC]

67
00:04:21.325 --> 00:04:24.930
Increased motion.

68
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:31.570
Now the leader will jump a bit in
counterpoint against those eighth notes.

69
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.209
And in a moment that leader will seem to
be going even faster with the advent of

70
00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:37.165
16th notes.

71
00:04:37.165 --> 00:04:39.863
[MUSIC]

72
00:04:39.863 --> 00:04:42.728
Second chorus picks up the 16th notes.

73
00:04:42.728 --> 00:04:51.367
[MUSIC]

74
00:04:51.367 --> 00:04:53.500
All right, let's phase it out here.

75
00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.330
So again, although the tempo was
the same with this particular piece,

76
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.530
the psychological effect
of the piece is that it's

77
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.880
moving faster to build to a grand climax.

78
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.070
And I encourage you,
encourage you now to go on and

79
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:18.330
pick this up with the full presentation
by Steve Malinowski on YouTube.

80
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:24.090
So that's Mister Pachelbel,
that's Mister Pachelbel.

81
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.184
Let's move on now,
south across the Alps to Venice and

82
00:05:28.184 --> 00:05:32.019
learn about
Antonio Vivaldi's Spring Concerto.
