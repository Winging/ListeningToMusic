[MUSIC]

2
00:00:12.885 --> 00:00:16.021
As you heard with the opening
slide here for this segment,

3
00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:20.373
we're going to engage now the first
movement of Antonio Vivaldi's well known,

4
00:00:20.373 --> 00:00:21.848
The "Spring" Concerto.

5
00:00:21.848 --> 00:00:25.020
Let's start with Vivaldi himself.

6
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.040
As you can see from the main points
of this slide, he was born in Venice,

7
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.700
reared around the church of San Marco,
the Basilica of San Marco.

8
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.530
He became an ordained priest but
continued to develop a career as

9
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.680
an opera composer and composer of
instrumental music, and as a teacher.

10
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:52.530
But let's move on now, to Venice itself.

11
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.110
Here you see,
San Marco in the very center there, and

12
00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.350
the Doge's Palace off to the right.

13
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.549
Now we're going to slide a little
bit to the right down the,

14
00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:08.061
the waterway here to this church,
the Church of the Ospedale della Pieta,

15
00:01:08.061 --> 00:01:10.440
the Church of Hospice of Mercy.

16
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.080
It was actually an orphanage for girls.

17
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.740
An orphanage for girls who were
trained specifically in music.

18
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.130
Let's move now to the high alter.

19
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.560
Here's the high alter of this orphanage,
convent, music conservatory.

20
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.680
Now, we're going to take a look at,
I guess, the North Wall.

21
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.240
Yes, it would be the North Wall.

22
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.010
And you see the balcony here, the gallery.

23
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:41.610
And note carefully the metal grill and
the organ in the background.

24
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.650
So here's how it looks today.

25
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.550
And here's how it looks,
here's how it looked in Vivaldi's day,

26
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.310
with the girls singing and
playing behind the screen.

27
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.460
And you can still see the organ there.

28
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.890
As we saw,
Vivaldi was the master of the concerto.

29
00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.500
He wrote 450 of them.

30
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.450
Some concertos which he wrote for
solo instruments such as violin, flute,

31
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.430
and even instruments such as
the guitar and the mandolin.

32
00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.450
Others were concertos for
small groups of soloists.

33
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.530
Two violins or three violins, for example.

34
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.600
Let's see the difference
between a solo concerto, and

35
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.160
what's called a concerto grosso.

36
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.900
So as you can see here, we've got
the genre of music called a concerto,

37
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:39.130
in which one or more soloists play,
with and against a larger orchestra.

38
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.380
We have a solo concerto,

39
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.800
that's one type of concerto in which
we've got just a soloist plus orchestra.

40
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.450
And in the Baroque period we've got
this genre called the concerto grosso,

41
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.090
which has several soloists plus orchestra.

42
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:59.670
When they all play together, soloists and
full orchestra, that's called the tutti.

43
00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.620
But that full group can be divided
into a big group, a larger group,

44
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.870
called the concerto grosso,
and a smaller group,

45
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.790
the little group of just
soloists called the concertino.

46
00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.280
So we've got these soloists, and

47
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.600
we've, basically we've got
everybody playing together.

48
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.380
Generally speaking, concerti grossi
are written for three movements, or

49
00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.550
are written in three movements,
fast-slow-fast.

50
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.800
The popularity of the genre peaked about
1730 and then diminished thereafter.

51
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.020
But that the solo concerto
continued into the Romantic period.

52
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.950
Indeed, and really, even into the Modern
period as well, because it offered

53
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:46.560
the opportunity for, in fact, a single
soloist to showcase his or her styles.

54
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.282
Now, these pieces, these genres,
of the concerto grosso,

55
00:03:51.282 --> 00:03:53.630
fast-slow-fast in terms of movements.

56
00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.580
The first movement was usually
written in ritornello form.

57
00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.030
So let's take a look at
that now in our next slide.

58
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.180
And it's a very simple idea.

59
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.250
It's just an alter, alternation.

60
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.680
Much as we have in ritorn, rondo form.

61
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.030
Much as we have in rondo form,
of this idea of a refrain.

62
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.480
Refrain played by everybody is called,
an Italia ritornello.

63
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.130
The refrain played by everyone
alternating with, soloists.

64
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.660
The concertino, playing,
soloist derived from the ritornello.

65
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.910
And then the tutti will come
back with the ritornello.

66
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.100
More soloists, more tutti ritornello,
more soloists, and

67
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.530
so on, it goes, until the end.

68
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.140
So, let's take a look now at
a slide that will get us up to

69
00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:51.010
speed with regard to the famous Concerto
in E Major, the "Spring" Concerto.

70
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:59.220
As you may know, Vivaldi wrote
a set of four concerti grossi for,

71
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:04.060
Baroque orchestra,
The Four Seasons in which each in turn

72
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.420
intends to depict the feelings and sounds
and sights of the different seasons.

73
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.250
And to set the mood, Vivaldi wrote a poem,
an illustrative sonnet for each.

74
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.510
The poem is descriptive but
the music more so.

75
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:25.240
So any time we have music that tries
to play out through sound, a poem,

76
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.110
a narrative, even an historical event,
we call that program music.

77
00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.500
So we've got a good example
of program music here

78
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.940
with Vivaldi's "Spring" Concerto.

79
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.210
So let's start with the beginning of the,
"Spring" Concerto.

80
00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.060
The first movement.

81
00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.080
It's written in Ritornello form.

82
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.240
It has something that we
call terraced dynamics,

83
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.750
sudden shifts between loud and soft.

84
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.410
And we'll hear that in just a moment.

85
00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:57.030
And we've got something
called a melodic sequence.

86
00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:58.300
What's a melodic sequence?

87
00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.940
Well, it's the repetition of
the musical motive at a successive,

88
00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.730
at successively higher or
lower degrees of the scale.

89
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:09.370
We can sound this out here.

90
00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.220
We have, you'll hear a motive played, and

91
00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.710
then it's repeated, and
then it's repeated again.

92
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.050
One, two, three, and each time it
shows up, it's slightly lower.

93
00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:21.800
I think I've got an audio clip.

94
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.647
Let's listen to this.

95
00:06:22.647 --> 00:06:29.809
[MUSIC]

96
00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:31.930
Okay, so that's a melodic sequence.

97
00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:33.228
Again.
[MUSIC]

98
00:06:33.228 --> 00:06:39.360
Motif, second playing,
third playing, each time going down.

99
00:06:42.348 --> 00:06:45.971
So here we have the first movement,
with its Ritornello, and

100
00:06:45.971 --> 00:06:49.467
the Ritornello is divided into two parts,
Parts 1 and 2.

101
00:06:49.467 --> 00:06:57.943
[MUSIC]

102
00:06:57.943 --> 00:07:00.566
Part 1 and Part 2, begins with a leap.

103
00:07:00.566 --> 00:07:06.221
[MUSIC]

104
00:07:06.221 --> 00:07:10.480
So those are the two
parts of the Ritornello.

105
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.385
So let's listen now to
the entire movement,

106
00:07:14.385 --> 00:07:18.302
following along with
the first violin part.

107
00:07:18.302 --> 00:07:21.843
[MUSIC]

108
00:07:21.843 --> 00:07:24.827
So here, we start with the ritornello.

109
00:07:24.827 --> 00:07:26.951
Notice the music is now suddenly quieter.

110
00:07:26.951 --> 00:07:28.250
Piano.

111
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:29.706
Good example of terraced dynamics.

112
00:07:29.706 --> 00:07:31.798
Falls off.

113
00:07:31.798 --> 00:07:32.747
Back up.

114
00:07:32.747 --> 00:07:34.258
Sudden shift.

115
00:07:34.258 --> 00:07:35.756
Terrace dynamics.

116
00:07:35.756 --> 00:07:38.930
One, to the next.

117
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:40.695
And then suddenly quieter.

118
00:07:40.695 --> 00:07:48.717
[MUSIC]

119
00:07:48.717 --> 00:07:53.210
Okay, this is our first,
statement by the concertino.

120
00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.980
Soloist, two violinists working here.

121
00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:00.015
Playing trills and
notes close to each other high up,

122
00:08:00.015 --> 00:08:02.992
imitating obviously the sounds
of birds in spring.

123
00:08:02.992 --> 00:08:12.992
[MUSIC]

124
00:08:18.061 --> 00:08:20.781
And now, the ritornello will come back.

125
00:08:20.781 --> 00:08:22.606
Ritornello, Part 2.

126
00:08:22.606 --> 00:08:27.226
[MUSIC]

127
00:08:27.226 --> 00:08:31.963
Now, as you can see from all of
these fast-moving 16th notes.

128
00:08:31.963 --> 00:08:32.962
[MUSIC]

129
00:08:32.962 --> 00:08:34.370
We've got action here.

130
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:38.852
And this is Vivaldi's attempt to
represent in music the motions of

131
00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:40.780
a babbling brook or stream.

132
00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:44.798
[MUSIC]

133
00:08:44.798 --> 00:08:45.773
Okay.

134
00:08:45.773 --> 00:08:49.035
[MUSIC]

135
00:08:49.035 --> 00:08:50.731
I'm going to pause it right here.

136
00:08:50.731 --> 00:08:52.500
I'm going to pause it right here.

137
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.980
Tell me,
you're about to hear Ritornello Part 2.

138
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:56.950
Anything different?

139
00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:58.360
Maybe I can even move it back.

140
00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.020
Yeah.

141
00:08:59.020 --> 00:08:59.620
Hey good for me.

142
00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:00.960
I'm going to move it back.

143
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.740
What's the difference
between Ritornello Part 2,

144
00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.330
first statement and the present statement?

145
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:07.720
Let's see if I can get it going.

146
00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.299
I bet I can.

147
00:09:08.299 --> 00:09:18.062
[MUSIC]

148
00:09:18.062 --> 00:09:18.574
All right.

149
00:09:18.574 --> 00:09:19.850
Did you hear the difference?

150
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:20.840
Could you tell the difference?

151
00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.770
Well, he's taken it down.

152
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:24.294
He's down from here.

153
00:09:24.294 --> 00:09:27.139
[MUSIC]

154
00:09:27.139 --> 00:09:28.115
To down to here.

155
00:09:28.115 --> 00:09:32.734
[MUSIC]

156
00:09:32.734 --> 00:09:34.160
So he's taking it down.

157
00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.910
Actually taking it down to the dom.

158
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:38.850
Now we're going to pick it up and
the music gets very agitated.

159
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:43.985
You'll hear the violin technique of
tremolo and then suddenly races up.

160
00:09:43.985 --> 00:09:46.724
Races up like, almost like lightning bolt.

161
00:09:46.724 --> 00:09:52.842
Well, of course this is Vivaldi's
attempt to represent a storm in spring.

162
00:09:52.842 --> 00:10:02.842
[MUSIC]

163
00:10:12.729 --> 00:10:13.983
It's up.

164
00:10:13.983 --> 00:10:15.446
Another statement of theme.

165
00:10:15.446 --> 00:10:16.327
What's different?

166
00:10:16.327 --> 00:10:23.561
[MUSIC]

167
00:10:23.561 --> 00:10:25.267
Did you hear the difference?

168
00:10:25.267 --> 00:10:27.310
[MUSIC]

169
00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:30.481
Two.
[MUSIC]

170
00:10:30.481 --> 00:10:32.960
So went from major to minor.

171
00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:38.470
He's modulated, the composer modulates
in these concertino sections,

172
00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:40.610
modulates to the minor.

173
00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:41.711
Let's go on.

174
00:10:41.711 --> 00:10:48.689
[MUSIC]

175
00:10:48.689 --> 00:10:51.010
So there's our statement in minor.

176
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:56.800
Now the sun's coming back out,
storms over.

177
00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.767
Rising up,
rising up chromatically in the violins.

178
00:10:59.767 --> 00:11:01.103
[MUSIC]

179
00:11:01.103 --> 00:11:06.489
Everybody's happy,
the world is right again.

180
00:11:06.489 --> 00:11:10.088
Back to the [INAUDIBLE]
our major statement.

181
00:11:10.088 --> 00:11:15.091
[MUSIC]

182
00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:17.448
Playing Ritornello Part 1.

183
00:11:17.448 --> 00:11:20.073
Now we're going to build
up to a final climax.

184
00:11:20.073 --> 00:11:25.969
[MUSIC]

185
00:11:25.969 --> 00:11:31.600
And finally back home,
tonic key, Ritornello Part 2.

186
00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:41.600
[MUSIC]

187
00:11:49.629 --> 00:11:52.842
All right, that's an energetic
movement from a concerto,

188
00:11:52.842 --> 00:11:55.940
the "Spring" Concerto, by Antonio Vivaldi.

189
00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.229
Let's review some terms.

190
00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:00.910
Solo concerto.

191
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:04.850
Obviously that is a soloist playing
along with and against an orchestra.

192
00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:08.230
Concerto grosso involves a concertino
in which there are a group of

193
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:11.940
soloists playing along with and
against an orchestra.

194
00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:16.800
Ritorello is a refrain,
that comes back again and again.

195
00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.630
A melodic refrain that returns.

196
00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:20.780
Tutti means everybody in the orchestra,

197
00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:23.110
including the soloist,
playing all together.

198
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:26.080
Concertino is simply
the small group of soloists.

199
00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:33.460
Terrace dynamics indicate these abrupt
shifts of loud and soft in Baroque music.

200
00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:39.130
Program music is simply music that
attempts to portray through sound.

201
00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:43.040
A poem, a narrative, a story,
or some historical event.

202
00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:48.280
And melodic sequence have we, as we have
seen, is the repetition of a musical

203
00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:54.070
motive at successively higher or
lower degrees of the scale.

204
00:12:57.030 --> 00:13:00.400
Now, that famous movement that we
just heard from Vivaldi's "Spring"

205
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.460
Concerto lasts about three minutes and
ten seconds.

206
00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:06.251
Next session we'll turn
to a concerto by J.S.

207
00:13:06.251 --> 00:13:10.030
Bach that will last three times
as long as Vivaldi's movement.

208
00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:13.820
Which gives us something to look
forward to with regards to Bach and

209
00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:18.040
his endless capacity for
musical invention.

210
00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:18.552
See you then.
