00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.080
Hello.

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.700
Well, we're now finished filming
all 24 hours of our course,

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.090
introduction to classical music.

4
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.000
And you might be wondering,
what you might be getting into,

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.110
what kind of experience
you might have here?

6
00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.140
Well let's take a preview.

7
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.890
The first six sessions tell us why
music matters, why it moves us so

8
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.910
much, why so
many people listen to it every day.

9
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.370
And they provide the technical
information that you'll need to

10
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.690
fully enjoy classical music.

11
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.060
By technical information,
I mean what we'll need to know about.

12
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.720
How music works, at it's most basic level.

13
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.320
About rhythm, melody, harmony, and so on.

14
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.180
How technical is this going to get?

15
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.540
Well, here's a sample moment from
our discussion of rhythm in music.

16
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.504
Rhythm is a bit more complicated.

17
00:00:52.504 --> 00:00:58.072
Rhythm is the organization of time
into compelling patterns of long and

18
00:00:58.072 --> 00:01:00.280
short sounds.

19
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.030
Here's a famous melody, one created
by the French composer Maurice Ravel

20
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.030
from his ballet Bolero of 1928.

21
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.720
There is a tune, a succession of higher
and lower pitches shown vertically,

22
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.480
and there is a rhythm
moving left to right.

23
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.130
Now lets strip away pitch and
leave the rhythm alone and

24
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.650
it will look like this as
we see on our next slide.

25
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:36.010
But what we hear first at the beginning
of Bolero, is not the melody but

26
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.160
another rhythm.

27
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.420
This one.

28
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.200
And it's played by a snare drum.

29
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.590
Now, a snare drum, as you may know,
has no particular pitch.

30
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.930
It just plays a rhythm, pure rhythm.

31
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.320
I'll tap it.

32
00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:01.212
[MUSIC]

33
00:02:01.212 --> 00:02:04.110
And that's all the snare drum player does.

34
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.046
So he better write that pattern.

35
00:02:05.046 --> 00:02:09.129
He's going to be doing it for
the next 14 and a half minutes.

36
00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.681
Now, beneath the snare drum pattern,

37
00:02:11.681 --> 00:02:16.730
low strange play, another rhythm that
provides something of a harmony.

38
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.310
Let's take a look at that now.

39
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:25.182
[NOISE]
And

40
00:02:25.182 --> 00:02:30.337
so on.

41
00:02:30.337 --> 00:02:36.390
Eventually the flute enters,
adding the enchanting melody.

42
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.390
So now we have three
rhythms operating here.

43
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.680
One in the flute,
which also carries the melody.

44
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.690
One in the snare drum,
which is a simple or pure rhythm.

45
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.060
And the third in the bass,

46
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.420
which is providing something of
a harmony below the melody up above.

47
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.550
So we have three rhythms
that are staying within and

48
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.650
emphasizing the structure of the measure.

49
00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.750
Three different rhythms
sounding simultaneously,

50
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.720
three different patterns of longs and
shorts.

51
00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.820
Having learned about the elements
of music, what makes music work?

52
00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.430
We'll move on now to listening to
great pieces of classical music.

53
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.100
Starting with Gregorian Chant and
working up to the Renaissance, and

54
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.350
then the Baroque Era.

55
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.320
Here's a sample from the Baroque Era,
featuring music by Handel,

56
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.740
the composer of course of
the oratorical Messiah.

57
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:33.440
But here, we're discussing the music for
the royal fireworks, again by Handel.

58
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.720
Combined with them is the English group,
The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment.

59
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.004
I'll comment as we go.

60
00:03:41.004 --> 00:03:44.920
[MUSIC]

61
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:51.504
Starting with replica of natural trumpets,
no vowels

62
00:03:51.504 --> 00:03:53.754
[MUSIC]

63
00:03:53.754 --> 00:03:57.004
So here's the minuette.

64
00:03:57.004 --> 00:04:02.500
Notice that the tempo of
course is much slower.

65
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:10.110
I would say that the playing
is a lot cleaner.

66
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:16.838
[MUSIC]

67
00:04:16.838 --> 00:04:21.370
This was a difficult technique,
this clarino playing from the Baroque era.

68
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.629
Only specialists could do it.

69
00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:25.129
[MUSIC]

70
00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:27.000
Obviously overdo the oboes.

71
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.720
See the old oboe, in the middle of the
orchestra, authentic performance practice.

72
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.390
What we don't see here is a conductor.

73
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.010
The first violinist is conducting,
and that's correct.

74
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.690
There were no conductors standing and
waving batons in those days.

75
00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.950
So the first violinist is conducting here.

76
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:47.638
And he's very, very,

77
00:04:47.638 --> 00:04:51.422
[MUSIC]

78
00:04:51.422 --> 00:04:52.837
The natural horns.

79
00:04:52.837 --> 00:05:02.837
[MUSIC]

80
00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:40.462
Pretty impressive.

81
00:05:40.462 --> 00:05:43.420
Next we go on to a discussion
of classical music,

82
00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.100
with Haydn and specially with Mozart.

83
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.440
But here, let's look at a clip
demonstrating how classical Beethoven

84
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.880
constructs a symphony, specifically
his Eroica, or heroic, symphony.

85
00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.509
During most of these years, Beethoven was
living here, at the Pascualati House,

86
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.050
which happened to be on
the ramparts of the old fortress.

87
00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.960
So, when Napoleon unleashed his hundreds
of cannons at the old city fortresses,

88
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.100
well, Beethoven had a ringside seat.

89
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.370
And although he was nearly deaf,
he was terrified by the sound and

90
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.260
the destruction of the cannons.

91
00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.870
Well anyway,
enough about Beethoven and the poem.

92
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.020
Let's get to the music.

93
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:32.670
To do so, we'll start with the opening
sounds of the Eroica Symphony.

94
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:35.090
Let's see what's revolutionary about it.

95
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:38.230
As we listen, you identify three things,

96
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:43.280
three ways in which this music
differs from Mozart of Haydn.

97
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.460
What is Beethoven doing here that Mozart,
for example, would not have done?

98
00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.451
And here again we're going to employ
a video made by Steve Melanosky.

99
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.660
Two hammer strokes right at the beginning.

100
00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.005
Then the theme appears, not in the first
violins like we would expect but

101
00:07:01.005 --> 00:07:01.629
in the cellos.

102
00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:12.046
[MUSIC]

103
00:07:12.046 --> 00:07:14.030
Now the woodwinds take over the theme.

104
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.087
Takes it up a step.

105
00:07:18.087 --> 00:07:19.890
Up another step.

106
00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:21.087
[MUSIC]

107
00:07:21.087 --> 00:07:24.380
And now we get ready for

108
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:29.587
some heavy-handed syncopation.

109
00:07:29.587 --> 00:07:32.587
[MUSIC]
More syncopation.

110
00:07:32.587 --> 00:07:33.879
Now, everybody in!

111
00:07:33.879 --> 00:07:35.172
Full orchestra.

112
00:07:35.172 --> 00:07:45.172
[MUSIC]

113
00:07:47.587 --> 00:07:52.118
From a live classroom,
to an online mode of delivery,

114
00:07:52.118 --> 00:07:55.565
such as we have in our online course here,

115
00:07:55.565 --> 00:08:01.430
we knew we had to take music and
make it less audio and more video.

116
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:06.920
We knew that the Internet is not
good at delivering quality sound.

117
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:11.760
But it is good at letting us see how
things work, even see how music works,

118
00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:17.140
hear animations, and diagrams,
and video clips of all sorts.

119
00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:20.944
They all allow us to understand,
to demystify,

120
00:08:20.944 --> 00:08:28.020
classical music as we see here in famous
passage from a song of Gustave Mahler.

121
00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:29.970
As the text at the end says,

122
00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:35.074
I have escaped into a solitary
world of love and music.

123
00:08:35.074 --> 00:08:38.129
A love for music.

124
00:08:38.129 --> 00:08:44.780
[FOREIGN] In my love and
in my song, my music song.

125
00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:48.921
You're being a metaphor for all music.

126
00:08:48.921 --> 00:08:57.067
Let's

127
00:08:57.067 --> 00:09:05.213
listen

128
00:09:05.213 --> 00:09:13.358
to this

129
00:09:13.358 --> 00:09:23.358
beautiful

130
00:09:25.577 --> 00:09:35.080
piece as

131
00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:45.080
conducted

132
00:09:47.299 --> 00:09:50.014
by

133
00:09:50.014 --> 00:09:59.518
Claudio

134
00:09:59.518 --> 00:10:07.664
Abbado

135
00:10:07.664 --> 00:10:11.737
and

136
00:10:11.737 --> 00:10:19.882
sung by

137
00:10:19.882 --> 00:10:30.743
Magalina

138
00:10:30.743 --> 00:10:40.254
Piscina

139
00:10:40.254 --> 00:10:50.254
[MUSIC]

140
00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.950
Finally we've tried to be creative.

141
00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:10.220
And in so doing, sometimes we came close
to creating out own new art forms.

142
00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:13.640
As you see in this last
clip from a discussion

143
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.990
of the post-modernist
music of Phillip Glass.

144
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:20.837
So we have just this repeated note and
then this,

145
00:11:20.837 --> 00:11:27.180
[MUSIC]

146
00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:32.504
And then, slowly,
seventh chord will be introduced.

147
00:11:32.504 --> 00:11:34.232
[MUSIC]
And then another one, but

148
00:11:34.232 --> 00:11:35.880
another one going against it.

149
00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.421
[MUSIC]

150
00:11:37.421 --> 00:11:40.280
Opposite direction,
one coming down as one goes up.

151
00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.462
[MUSIC]

152
00:11:43.462 --> 00:11:49.047
And then he would double the tempo and
run them both up and down simultaneously.

153
00:11:49.047 --> 00:11:51.420
[MUSIC]

154
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:54.850
In that fashion.

155
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:59.608
So let's hear a bit of the original
composition flow by Phillip Glass, and

156
00:11:59.608 --> 00:12:04.291
as we do so, as these arpeggios are going
up and down against themselves,

157
00:12:04.291 --> 00:12:06.500
we'll look at this visual image.

158
00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:12.100
Each of these squares is
a rectangle against itself.

159
00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:18.711
You can study these rectangles or
these mirror images as the music plays.

160
00:12:18.711 --> 00:12:26.719
[MUSIC]

161
00:12:53.875 --> 00:13:00.568
Okay maybe we'll

162
00:13:00.568 --> 00:13:04.586
pause it.

163
00:13:04.586 --> 00:13:08.616
>> I hope you can see that we've tried
to be creative with our introduction to

164
00:13:08.616 --> 00:13:12.157
classical music,
we've tried to have some fun.

165
00:13:12.157 --> 00:13:14.147
For as we know in music, or

166
00:13:14.147 --> 00:13:19.477
anything else in life, we all are more
engaged when we're having fun.
