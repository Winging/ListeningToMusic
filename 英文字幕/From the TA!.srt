[MUSIC]

2
00:00:43.403 --> 00:00:46.190
Hi, welcome to Office Hours.

3
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.420
You might recognize the,
that part of the theme that I just played

4
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.370
which is from the second movement,
the opening of the second movement

5
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.590
of Dvorak's very well-known
New World Symphony.

6
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.680
It's his Symphony Number Nine.

7
00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.000
It was composed in 1893 while he was

8
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.830
serving as a director of
a conservatory here in the US.

9
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.040
This is a very, very well-known and,
and beloved piece.

10
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.000
And I actually wanted to talk with all of
you actually about the first movement,

11
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.060
not the second movement today,
which is still lovely.

12
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.893
But we're going to talk about the first
movement because I thought it might be fun

13
00:01:19.893 --> 00:01:24.243
to go through a, a piece, a movement
of a piece that is very well-known and

14
00:01:24.243 --> 00:01:27.508
hopefully recognizable for
many of you out there.

15
00:01:27.508 --> 00:01:32.372
And, and talk through it both from
a musical, descriptive level,

16
00:01:32.372 --> 00:01:37.395
but also to travel through it and look
at sonata form which is one of the major

17
00:01:37.395 --> 00:01:42.810
forms that we deal with in western
art music in, in classical music.

18
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.740
And I think that in using this piece as
an example, we can kind of see how some of

19
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.040
the familiar scenes that you might know
just from being an active listener,

20
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.160
can map on to the sonata form structure
that Dvorak has employed here.

21
00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.778
And, and countless of composers in
the Western art music tradition,

22
00:02:01.778 --> 00:02:05.544
have employed for
over two centuries at this point.

23
00:02:05.544 --> 00:02:10.237
So let's start out by
just talking a little bit

24
00:02:10.237 --> 00:02:13.850
about the framework of this symphony.

25
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.270
I'm going to go to
the white board over here.

26
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:22.280
And what we're going to do
is just very quickly map out

27
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.290
the kind of general sonata form structure
that you've learned it, which would be,

28
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.770
here we have the exposition, and
I'm just going to abbreviate that.

29
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.995
And then we know that there is a middle
section that is the development,

30
00:02:36.995 --> 00:02:41.974
and then at the end we have a third
part which is the recapitulation.

31
00:02:41.974 --> 00:02:44.737
We'll call it here, the recap.

32
00:02:50.138 --> 00:02:55.160
Broadly speaking, those are the three
main sections of a sonata form movement.

33
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.740
The exposition, of course, is in
charge of laying out all of the major

34
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.530
musical ideas of the form.

35
00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.090
So what we're going to do is
we're going to refer to these

36
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.300
areas as kind of zones or groups.

37
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:15.750
So we'll have a first theme,
zone or group.

38
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.840
Another way to think of it is as
a primary, primary theme, group.

39
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.750
Then usually there's
some sort of transition.

40
00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.090
Just transition.

41
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.910
Then we get to the second theme.

42
00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.580
Or we can call it our,
our secondary theme group, or zone.

43
00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.930
Of course, that'll go for a little bit,
and then we'll come to our

44
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.290
third thematic area or group, and

45
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.810
sometimes it's thought of as being
like the closing melodic area.

46
00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.880
So once again now we have kind
of the layout of our exposition.

47
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:04.140
This is going to give us the,
the primary not necessarily primary,

48
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.180
but the important musical ideas for
this sonata form, and

49
00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.500
then for the rest of the movement we're
going to see how these things play out.

50
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.230
There are many different things that
are implicated in a sonata form that we

51
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.940
are going to probably skip over for
now, because they

52
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.700
not only go into greater music
theoretical terms, but also they don't

53
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.260
always necessarily play out exactly the
same way from one sonata form to the next.

54
00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.097
We have to think of this as kind of
an ongoing tradition and an ongoing,

55
00:04:35.097 --> 00:04:40.070
maybe dialogue between a composer and
the music, a composer and

56
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.540
other composers who are using sonata form.

57
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.210
And of course the kind of
the history of sonata form as it

58
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.559
as it spreads across different countries
and different composers and styles.

59
00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.450
So not every composer is
going to do the same thing.

60
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.670
However, I'll just quickly kind of
highlight that often times when we move

61
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.730
from our first theme group to the second
theme group, there's usually a modulation

62
00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.670
and that often happens over
the course of the transition.

63
00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.290
And then usually the second and

64
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.740
third theme groups are going
to be in the same key.

65
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.630
But once again that's not a hard and
fast rule.

66
00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:24.610
So in traditional sonata forms,
you're actually going to have a repeat.

67
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.686
This is our,
this is the music sign for repeat.

68
00:05:28.686 --> 00:05:33.126
If you ever look at a music score and
you see this right here like that,

69
00:05:33.126 --> 00:05:36.957
that usually means to repeat
back either to the beginning or

70
00:05:36.957 --> 00:05:39.969
repeat back to the first
opening repeat sign.

71
00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:42.454
So if you see one of these
somewhere before it,

72
00:05:42.454 --> 00:05:45.019
this repeat sign's going to
tell you to go there.

73
00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:47.590
If you don't see that, it's going to
tell you go to the beginning.

74
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.460
Now we get to our development.

75
00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:57.440
A development usually entails
taking some of this material that

76
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.750
we've heard in the exposition and
actually developing it.

77
00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:06.480
Kind of playing with it,
giving some new twists or

78
00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.010
spins to it, kind of a metamorphosis.

79
00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:14.040
You might hear lots of modulations or
traveling to different key areas,

80
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.640
even though we don't necessarily stay
in those key areas for very long.

81
00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.165
And then this is kind of
the section that has the most

82
00:06:22.165 --> 00:06:26.930
free-flowing creativity,
well I shouldn't say creativity.

83
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.320
It has the most kind of
variability in the sonata form,

84
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.590
so for now I'm just going to do,
I'm going to represent that like this.

85
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.450
I'm just going to say, it's a lot of this
and then eventually there's going to be

86
00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:43.290
a moment where you can kind of tell
that the tension is building and

87
00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:47.310
then all of a sudden we now get
the onset of the recapitulation,

88
00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:52.890
which essentially is a conceptual
restatement of the exposition.

89
00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:58.150
So you know, we can think of this
kind of loose turn or A, B, A, right.

90
00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:59.330
A, B, A.

91
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:03.460
In the recap then we're going to
get the first theme group,

92
00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:08.110
second theme group,
third theme group again.

93
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:13.152
We can call it again PSC.

94
00:07:13.152 --> 00:07:18.378
And oftentimes there are going to
be some slight, modifications.

95
00:07:18.378 --> 00:07:23.310
It's not necessarily always going to be
an exact restatement of the exposition.

96
00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:27.080
For instance, if you recall, I just
said that oftentimes in sonata forms,

97
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.860
you will have a modulation between
the first and the second theme groups.

98
00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:35.200
In the recap, usually, that mod,
that modulation is going to be modified so

99
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.440
that you stay in the same key.

100
00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:40.200
That's kind of a typical move,
but again, once again,

101
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.350
it's not always the hard and fast rule.

102
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:45.944
So in this case,
let's just leave this as our broad layout.

103
00:07:45.944 --> 00:07:50.375
Now, in the Dvorak symphony, the New
World Symphony, in the first movement,

104
00:07:50.375 --> 00:07:54.809
we have an extra little component, which
I think we've also encountered in our

105
00:07:54.809 --> 00:07:58.678
course before, which is that before
the exposition even begins,.

106
00:07:58.678 --> 00:08:02.858
And I'm going to now erase a little
bit of this to create some room.

107
00:08:02.858 --> 00:08:07.091
Before the exposition begins,

108
00:08:07.091 --> 00:08:12.280
we actually have a slow introduction.

109
00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:16.260
And so this is also some material.

110
00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:21.500
Slow introduction, then there's going
to be a transition out of that,

111
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.710
into the onset of the exposition.

112
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.700
Now, in the Dvorak,
you're going to hear a repeat.

113
00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.250
That repeat, is actually not going
to take us all the way back to

114
00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:31.050
the beginning of the slow introduction.

115
00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:34.190
It's in fact going to take us back to
the beginning of the exposition proper.

116
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:39.960
So, you can think then,
of this as having a slow introduction,

117
00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:45.242
and then, repeat signs there, so that
you going to hear the entire exposition,

118
00:08:45.242 --> 00:08:48.640
then it's going to repeat
back to the exposition again.

119
00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.217
On the second pass through,
you're going to hear the same thing.

120
00:08:51.217 --> 00:08:53.990
When we get here there's going to
be a slight modification so

121
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:56.560
[LAUGH] that we don't repeat over and
over again.

122
00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:00.456
A slight modification that's going to
then lead us in to the development, and

123
00:09:00.456 --> 00:09:05.190
then we're going to go all the way through
to, to the recap, to the end of the piece.

124
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:09.310
So that's our crash course
again in sonata form.

125
00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:13.130
And now, what I'm going to do is I'm
going to walk you through some of

126
00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:16.210
the themes that we're going to
hear in this movement.

127
00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:18.950
And then we're going to
actually walk through

128
00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:21.040
a listening of the entire movement.

129
00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:24.640
It takes about 11 minutes or so and

130
00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:28.280
I'll try my best to not talk
too much over the audio.

131
00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:32.920
But I think I will talk over the audio so
that I can guide you as we're going and

132
00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:38.100
we can, we can talk about what
we're hearing in real time.

133
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:44.200
So, at the very beginning,
our first theme.

134
00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.910
And I'm not going to play all of
these themes in their entirety.

135
00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:53.840
One of the interesting things about music,
and music as it takes

136
00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:58.260
place in larger forms like this,
is that there is some flexibility

137
00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:04.630
with how we define various concepts.

138
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:07.476
When we say a theme,
we usually do mean though kind of a,

139
00:10:07.476 --> 00:10:11.620
a relatively self-encloser at least.

140
00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:16.860
And a noticeable or parsable melody that
you can kind of say has a beginning and

141
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.480
possibly an end.

142
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:24.343
In, in, in this case the theme is somewhat
longer and made up of smaller gestures.

143
00:10:24.343 --> 00:10:27.648
So I'll play you kind of the main
idea here which just goes

144
00:10:27.648 --> 00:10:37.648
[MUSIC]

145
00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.200
And then keeps going.

146
00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.234
So this theme has like a very
noticeable idea, which is.

147
00:10:45.234 --> 00:10:48.601
[MUSIC]

148
00:10:48.601 --> 00:10:50.090
And then keeps going.

149
00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:52.430
Now it's that, will take place.

150
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:56.260
And then we're going to hear more music,
which obviously ensues.

151
00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:00.310
And, and there's not necessarily
a clear distinction between like,

152
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:05.160
Oh, the theme has stopped right here and
this is clearly non-thematic material.

153
00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:09.572
However, there are, there will be points
in the music where you can tell that it's,

154
00:11:09.572 --> 00:11:13.740
that the music is not necessarily supposed
to be acting, you know, like a theme,

155
00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:17.886
but rather it's supposed to
be transitional material or

156
00:11:17.886 --> 00:11:20.020
kind of developmental material.

157
00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:22.940
As we go through the piece,
I'll kind of explain this further, and

158
00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.430
I hope that we'll be able
to here that more clearly.

159
00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:28.050
So that's our first theme.

160
00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:36.482
Then, the next theme is
going to take us to.

161
00:11:40.653 --> 00:11:42.788
It's going to take us to
the second theme group.

162
00:11:42.788 --> 00:11:44.523
And that one goes.

163
00:11:44.523 --> 00:11:53.699
[MUSIC]

164
00:11:53.699 --> 00:11:54.660
Like that.

165
00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.480
That's our second theme group.

166
00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:00.860
And, once again, you're going to hear that
develop and it's going to keep going.

167
00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:07.050
And then we're going to experience
transition to our third theme group,

168
00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:11.830
which sounds much more relaxed
then the first two themes.

169
00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:15.254
This one goes like this.

170
00:12:15.254 --> 00:12:24.497
[MUSIC]

171
00:12:24.497 --> 00:12:25.960
And then keeps going.

172
00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:30.505
Now one thing you might notice about
that theme, maybe not right away, but

173
00:12:30.505 --> 00:12:34.341
the very first rhythmic idea in
this theme right here, which is

174
00:12:34.341 --> 00:12:36.542
[MUSIC]

175
00:12:36.542 --> 00:12:37.720
like that.

176
00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:42.648
Actually it has the exact same
rhythm as our first theme which was

177
00:12:42.648 --> 00:12:44.884
[MUSIC]

178
00:12:44.884 --> 00:12:48.760
So now let me pull the melody out of it,
let's pull the notes out of it and

179
00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.820
just think of it as pure rhythm.

180
00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:52.558
So the very first theme goes

181
00:12:52.558 --> 00:12:54.760
[MUSIC]

182
00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:55.496
like that.

183
00:12:55.496 --> 00:12:57.663
[MUSIC]

184
00:12:57.663 --> 00:12:59.599
And then our third theme goes.

185
00:12:59.599 --> 00:13:01.767
[MUSIC]

186
00:13:01.767 --> 00:13:06.002
So you can see how these two ideas
are somewhat related, even at a kind of

187
00:13:06.002 --> 00:13:10.109
rhythmic level, even though they
have very different characters.

188
00:13:10.109 --> 00:13:17.183
The very first theme, as you're going to
hear has a, a more emphatic quality to it.

189
00:13:17.183 --> 00:13:21.280
While, while this theme,
the third theme, sounds more pastoral.

190
00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.088
But yet
they share the same opening rhythmic idea.

191
00:13:24.088 --> 00:13:28.110
So there's a, a link there that is not
necessarily immediately audible, or

192
00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:29.960
maybe it was.

193
00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.290
Maybe it was to you when,
when you just heard them now.

194
00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:36.745
Either way, whether you recognized it
off the bat or not, it's there and that,

195
00:13:36.745 --> 00:13:41.749
that kind of adds some additional
kind of quality of rela,

196
00:13:41.749 --> 00:13:45.280
an additional relationship
to the different themes.

197
00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:49.640
So, that's part of the way that
sonata-formed themes work is that each

198
00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:52.470
theme often has a different
sort of character to it.

199
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:57.220
And that's also how we can keep
track of them throughout the piece,

200
00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:01.260
is that they can be they can have a kind
of a certain identity of their own.

201
00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:08.260
All right, so now that we've heard those
three themes, let's just start here at

202
00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:14.900
the beginning of this movement, and
travel through and, and see how we fair.

203
00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:19.670
So, I'm going to go to the very beginning.

204
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:20.580
And here we go.

205
00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:23.810
Here are, we are at our slow introduction.

206
00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:27.317
We're using a recording by
the New York Philharmonic conducted by

207
00:14:27.317 --> 00:14:28.718
Leonard Bernstein.

208
00:14:28.718 --> 00:14:33.346
The reason why I chose this is ultimately
because I like the recording [LAUGH] and

209
00:14:33.346 --> 00:14:37.463
I think Leonard Bernstein is a,
is a very nice interpreter of this music.

210
00:14:37.463 --> 00:14:42.421
But also for, equally important is
that it is one of the recording, or

211
00:14:42.421 --> 00:14:47.083
one of the few recordings out there
that I've found that actually does play

212
00:14:47.083 --> 00:14:48.790
the expositional repeat.

213
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:51.560
And I think that's really important for
us to be able to hear.

214
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.590
Sometimes conductors will
make the decision and

215
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:55.940
there are many reasons for it.

216
00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:59.640
It could be recording you know, depending
on when it was recorded it could've been

217
00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:03.950
the limit in, in the time that they wanted
to give to the overall recording, and

218
00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:06.200
sometimes to save the time,
they will skip the repeat.

219
00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.800
It could've just have been
an artistic decision.

220
00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:09.580
But in this case,

221
00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:14.210
what we are getting is the full version
of the movement that includes the repeat.

222
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:17.003
So here we go, from the, from the top.

223
00:15:17.003 --> 00:15:27.003
[MUSIC]

224
00:15:33.953 --> 00:15:38.224
As you can see, it's a very somber mood.

225
00:15:38.224 --> 00:15:40.470
Low register, very quiet.

226
00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:50.470
[MUSIC]

227
00:16:34.967 --> 00:16:40.634
Mounting

228
00:16:40.634 --> 00:16:49.135
tension right

229
00:16:49.135 --> 00:16:53.387
here.

230
00:16:53.387 --> 00:16:58.971
Right here, rumbling of what will become

231
00:16:58.971 --> 00:17:03.763
our first theme, here it is again.

232
00:17:03.763 --> 00:17:10.236
Violent outburst.

233
00:17:10.236 --> 00:17:16.409
And building.

234
00:17:16.409 --> 00:17:20.279
And right here is the start
of our exposition.

235
00:17:20.279 --> 00:17:24.236
[INAUDIBLE]
So

236
00:17:24.236 --> 00:17:28.912
you can here how

237
00:17:28.912 --> 00:17:34.667
this theme has been

238
00:17:34.667 --> 00:17:41.861
generating momentum,

239
00:17:41.861 --> 00:17:50.142
now we're moving onward.

240
00:17:50.142 --> 00:17:53.713
You hear the theme again.

241
00:17:53.713 --> 00:17:57.616
Now I'm traveling.

242
00:17:57.616 --> 00:18:01.909
Your

243
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:10.495
sequence

244
00:18:10.495 --> 00:18:16.936
here.

245
00:18:16.936 --> 00:18:17.903
All right.

246
00:18:17.903 --> 00:18:19.438
Now.

247
00:18:19.438 --> 00:18:23.743
We've reached our second theme.

248
00:18:23.743 --> 00:18:27.713
And you hear the oboe.

249
00:18:27.713 --> 00:18:37.283
Transfers

250
00:18:37.283 --> 00:18:42.599
to the

251
00:18:42.599 --> 00:18:52.171
strings.

252
00:18:52.171 --> 00:18:54.920
So as you can see,
we're traveling again now.

253
00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.410
It's kind of in transition here.

254
00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:02.740
Some turbulent music and
then it seems to relax again.

255
00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:06.620
More relax.

256
00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:11.915
Now you can kind of feel the slower role.

257
00:19:11.915 --> 00:19:16.900
Here's our third theme.

258
00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:19.890
The flute.

259
00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:24.390
Once again, transferred to that strings.

260
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:29.785
Momentum's

261
00:19:29.785 --> 00:19:34.700
building.

262
00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:37.570
Final presentation, of this third theme.

263
00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:44.557
Where are we going back?

264
00:19:44.557 --> 00:19:48.060
Back to the beginning, or
to the beginning of our exposition.

265
00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:55.608
So here we are, we've now
experienced the expositional repeat,

266
00:19:55.608 --> 00:19:59.800
we're back in our first theme area.

267
00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:06.516
So on the second pass visualized and

268
00:20:06.516 --> 00:20:12.150
also hear your way through the form.

269
00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:16.160
First theme again.

270
00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.710
Now, traveling.

271
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:24.940
Here's our

272
00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:31.170
sequence.

273
00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:33.806
Okay, here we are, traveling again.

274
00:20:33.806 --> 00:20:35.710
We have a change, slow change in mood.

275
00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:41.110
Feel kind of

276
00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:46.510
a deflation

277
00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:52.992
a little bit.

278
00:20:52.992 --> 00:20:54.918
Now second theme.
Transfers to the, the middle strings.

279
00:20:54.918 --> 00:21:04.881
Another outburst.

280
00:21:04.881 --> 00:21:10.440
And they're building again and
getting a head of steam.

281
00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:14.262
It kind of breaks through and

282
00:21:14.262 --> 00:21:18.250
now again kind of turbulent.

283
00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:21.955
Relax.

284
00:21:21.955 --> 00:21:28.634
And again, building

285
00:21:28.634 --> 00:21:33.833
again, relax.

286
00:21:33.833 --> 00:21:34.740
Here we go again.

287
00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:39.897
Third theme, you can hear

288
00:21:39.897 --> 00:21:44.590
how pastoral it feels.

289
00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:53.676
Another iteration

290
00:21:53.676 --> 00:21:59.353
of the third

291
00:21:59.353 --> 00:22:03.331
theme.

292
00:22:03.331 --> 00:22:08.501
Now we're going to travel through.

293
00:22:08.501 --> 00:22:10.536
You can hear now, we're traveling.

294
00:22:10.536 --> 00:22:18.310
And here's our onset of the development.

295
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:23.492
That sounds a little bit
like the third theme.

296
00:22:23.492 --> 00:22:28.258
But now, the development is happening here
as we see that kind of breaking it down.

297
00:22:28.258 --> 00:22:33.470
Ba ba ba ba, all right,

298
00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:37.119
so you can hear,

299
00:22:37.119 --> 00:22:42.857
there's a little snippet

300
00:22:42.857 --> 00:22:47.306
of our first theme.

301
00:22:47.306 --> 00:22:51.719
Some snippets of

302
00:22:51.719 --> 00:22:56.449
the first theme.

303
00:22:56.449 --> 00:22:58.250
Here you go,
another hark back to our first theme.

304
00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:02.988
You can hear now, we've moved again.

305
00:23:02.988 --> 00:23:05.391
Da, da, da, da, da, same thing.

306
00:23:05.391 --> 00:23:12.119
So now we're using a rhythmic

307
00:23:12.119 --> 00:23:17.236
jester from earlier.

308
00:23:17.236 --> 00:23:20.006
Now the oboe has it.

309
00:23:20.006 --> 00:23:24.410
Puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh.

310
00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:28.104
See, you can here how Dvorak is playing
with some of snippets of ideas from

311
00:23:28.104 --> 00:23:30.260
the exposition, piecing them together.

312
00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:34.484
And now we're back at the recap.

313
00:23:34.484 --> 00:23:38.965
And this should sound familiar because
this is pretty much what we get at

314
00:23:38.965 --> 00:23:41.440
the very beginning of the exposition.

315
00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:50.400
Here, you might notice there's
a modification happening.

316
00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:54.340
It's not exactly like it
was in the exposition.

317
00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:59.685
We're on our way to
the second theme group.

318
00:23:59.685 --> 00:24:06.250
And here.

319
00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:09.687
[MUSIC]

320
00:24:09.687 --> 00:24:11.264
It's still in the flutes though.

321
00:24:11.264 --> 00:24:14.632
[MUSIC]

322
00:24:14.632 --> 00:24:16.526
Then it gets past.

323
00:24:16.526 --> 00:24:17.929
This time stays in the woodwind family.

324
00:24:17.929 --> 00:24:27.929
[MUSIC]

325
00:24:39.314 --> 00:24:41.195
Here now again, tension.

326
00:24:41.195 --> 00:24:44.544
And a little relaxation.

327
00:24:44.544 --> 00:24:46.135
The same thing again.

328
00:24:46.135 --> 00:24:48.485
The swirling.

329
00:24:48.485 --> 00:24:53.744
And relax again.

330
00:24:53.744 --> 00:24:55.909
More relaxed.

331
00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:59.531
Lowering down.

332
00:24:59.531 --> 00:25:01.180
And here we are at our third theme.

333
00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:11.180
[MUSIC]

334
00:25:19.891 --> 00:25:23.711
All right, now we reach the end.

335
00:25:23.711 --> 00:25:26.631
Or, the point where we would be
at the end in our exposition.

336
00:25:26.631 --> 00:25:31.069
[MUSIC].

337
00:25:31.069 --> 00:25:32.846
Now we're recycling some key material.

338
00:25:32.846 --> 00:25:40.177
[MUSIC].

339
00:25:40.177 --> 00:25:41.251
All this is new, of course.

340
00:25:41.251 --> 00:25:45.401
[MUSIC].

341
00:25:45.401 --> 00:25:47.346
Coming off of again,
our first new material.

342
00:25:47.346 --> 00:25:51.412
[MUSIC]

343
00:25:51.412 --> 00:25:52.859
Feel the energy.

344
00:25:52.859 --> 00:25:53.649
Momentum.

345
00:25:53.649 --> 00:25:55.239
Feel the boom, boom, boom.

346
00:25:55.239 --> 00:25:59.016
[MUSIC]

347
00:25:59.016 --> 00:26:03.403
Feel the rhythm.
[MUSIC]

348
00:26:03.403 --> 00:26:04.106
First theme again.

349
00:26:04.106 --> 00:26:14.791
[MUSIC]

350
00:26:14.791 --> 00:26:17.948
So I'm going to go back to the whiteboard
here, to illustrate one thing.

351
00:26:17.948 --> 00:26:22.529
Which is that in the recap,
when we got to our third theme area,

352
00:26:22.529 --> 00:26:24.698
we heard the full iteration.

353
00:26:24.698 --> 00:26:28.149
[MUSIC]

354
00:26:28.149 --> 00:26:32.413
And then played all the way through and
then we got to that big conjubilant point.

355
00:26:32.413 --> 00:26:34.975
And of course at that
point in the exposition,

356
00:26:34.975 --> 00:26:37.810
we got to that jubilant point and
then we repeat it.

357
00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:40.920
And then, the second time we
went onto the development.

358
00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:44.061
This time we get to that
jubilant moment and

359
00:26:44.061 --> 00:26:47.900
then Dvorak basically ex,
extends the activity.

360
00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:49.561
He first of all, modulates.

361
00:26:49.561 --> 00:26:52.110
He moves us up a little bit.

362
00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:55.210
You could, you could, you could probably
hear that, we might play it again.

363
00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:57.070
But you hear it happens, it's jubilant.

364
00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:59.850
And then, it actually gets raised again.

365
00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:04.890
And then, we get a little kind of a tag
at the end where there's all this

366
00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:05.750
energy build up.

367
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:09.410
And as you can see, the whole orchestra
is kind of running, running, and

368
00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:11.870
the rhythm is getting more and
more intense.

369
00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:13.440
And what we have and, and

370
00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:16.880
I think that this concept has
also been presented before.

371
00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:18.844
But, what we get basically
here at the end.

372
00:27:18.844 --> 00:27:23.699
Right after our third
theme zone has happened

373
00:27:23.699 --> 00:27:27.536
is what we like to think of as a coda.

374
00:27:27.536 --> 00:27:34.790
Coda I believe comes from Italian word for
tail, I believe.

375
00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:42.410
And it really does kind of, add just a,
extra space on to our movement.

376
00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:44.660
Or it could happen in a,

377
00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:49.800
in a single contained piece that doesn't
have various movements, at the end.

378
00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:54.690
But anyway, we get a coda that basically
kind of gives us a final hoorah.

379
00:27:54.690 --> 00:28:01.860
In this case, the final hoorah is made
up of snippets of our first theme.

380
00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:03.084
Right and so
you could hear at the end there

381
00:28:03.084 --> 00:28:09.926
[MUSIC].

382
00:28:09.926 --> 00:28:11.453
Right?
And so and then it builds and

383
00:28:11.453 --> 00:28:14.300
it builds and
then at the very end it ends with a bang.

384
00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:19.870
So in this case, our sonata form
then had kind of two additions

385
00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:24.770
to our kind of classic exposition,
development, and recapitulation.

386
00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:27.810
We had a slow introduction
which was never repeated.

387
00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:30.930
And then we have a coda
which also only sounds once.

388
00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:35.323
And so, that's basically in a,
in a nutshell,

389
00:28:35.323 --> 00:28:42.665
a very nice encapsulation of sonata form
operating in some of the traditional ways.

390
00:28:42.665 --> 00:28:48.093
And then, in some of the kind of
added bonus ways and

391
00:28:48.093 --> 00:28:52.559
this is by no means unique to Dvorak.

392
00:28:52.559 --> 00:28:53.369
Haydn, for

393
00:28:53.369 --> 00:28:58.969
instance often had slow introductions to
movements that he wrote in sonata form.

394
00:28:58.969 --> 00:29:01.070
Mozart, Beethoven.

395
00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:09.130
So, this is by no means, something that
is a late 19th century development.

396
00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:14.450
This is, this is something that
composers even in the 18th,

397
00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:17.330
late 18th and early 19th century.

398
00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:22.100
Are already playing with
these kinds of features.

399
00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:24.930
In the way that they explore sonata form.

400
00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:28.900
But I think that this is a really
it's a really neat movement.

401
00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:34.018
Because we can hear a lot of cool themes
that have very distinctive characters.

402
00:29:34.018 --> 00:29:35.597
And we can see how they play up.

403
00:29:35.597 --> 00:29:38.403
So as you can see I've made these
little spirals here in the development.

404
00:29:38.403 --> 00:29:40.935
But really in the spirals
we could have written,

405
00:29:40.935 --> 00:29:42.866
we could have kind of notated things.

406
00:29:42.866 --> 00:29:46.427
Like he's playing with a third them,
playing some of the bits of our first

407
00:29:46.427 --> 00:29:49.076
them, and, of course,
there are also new material.

408
00:29:49.076 --> 00:29:49.710
I don't know.

409
00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:52.460
I'll just write the word new
thrown into the jumble there.

410
00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:55.550
And so, that's kind of the,
that's the point of a development section.

411
00:29:55.550 --> 00:30:01.020
The idea is that it's a,
a meditation, in sense, in a sense,

412
00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:05.990
or, or a kind of rumination on the
material that was given in our exposition.

413
00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:09.886
And of course, out of this Pssst.

414
00:30:09.886 --> 00:30:11.662
The recap comes.

415
00:30:11.662 --> 00:30:16.470
And so, that is basically how
our sonata form is working.

416
00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:20.680
What I'm going to do then is, let's
just play the very end of the recap and

417
00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.050
the coda one more time.

418
00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:25.110
So that you,
you can kind of get a sense, once again,

419
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:29.810
of how that transition works
out of the recap into the coda.

420
00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:33.325
And maybe we'll call it
a class at that point.

421
00:30:33.325 --> 00:30:37.725
So here let me put the bottom here.

422
00:30:37.725 --> 00:30:38.787
Maybe this is a good point.

423
00:30:38.787 --> 00:30:48.787
[MUSIC]

424
00:30:51.593 --> 00:30:53.310
So here we are.

425
00:30:53.310 --> 00:31:01.547
We're kind of at the tail end
of our second theme group.

426
00:31:01.547 --> 00:31:05.228
So you can hear, here we are,
relaxing, relaxing,

427
00:31:05.228 --> 00:31:08.015
[MUSIC]

428
00:31:08.015 --> 00:31:10.290
Sigh, and here's the third.

429
00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:20.290
[MUSIC]

430
00:31:28.111 --> 00:31:28.900
Here we are.

431
00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:30.503
Music in this jubilant moment here.

432
00:31:30.503 --> 00:31:38.417
[MUSIC]

433
00:31:38.417 --> 00:31:39.090
>> [INAUDIBLE] We're rising.

434
00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:45.011
[MUSIC]

435
00:31:45.011 --> 00:31:47.293
Here we are now, getting into coda.

436
00:31:47.293 --> 00:31:51.989
We're in coda world now.

437
00:31:51.989 --> 00:31:55.547
Here in coda world we're playing
with aspects of our first theme.

438
00:31:55.547 --> 00:31:57.271
All right.
[INAUDIBLE] this.

439
00:31:57.271 --> 00:32:01.289
[MUSIC]

440
00:32:01.289 --> 00:32:02.126
Momentum is building.

441
00:32:02.126 --> 00:32:02.706
Here we go.

442
00:32:02.706 --> 00:32:11.041
[MUSIC]

443
00:32:11.041 --> 00:32:12.207
And one more time, yep.

444
00:32:12.207 --> 00:32:20.282
[MUSIC]

445
00:32:20.282 --> 00:32:22.481
It's a very emphatic end to that movement.

446
00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:28.970
And, of course, what follows this movement
probably after a few seconds of break for

447
00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:32.680
a, both conductor and
orchestra, and audience,

448
00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:36.440
to kind of breath and, and have
a moment after that big adrenalin rush.

449
00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:40.570
Was, of course, the second movement,
which starts out with some big,

450
00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:43.870
kind of broad chords in, in the brass.

451
00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:50.490
And, of course, the same melody that you
heard me playing when we started out here.

452
00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:53.210
So I'm going to now,
I'm going to play, again,

453
00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:56.220
that melody from the second movement,
the very famous melody.

454
00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:58.830
I think it also has the nickname.

455
00:32:58.830 --> 00:32:59.360
Going home.

456
00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:03.790
This is what you would hear if you were
at a concert then you were at a symphony.

457
00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:05.590
You would hear that movement,

458
00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:08.800
then you would hear the opening of
the second movement, and then this melody,

459
00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.420
which is actually not played by
the violin but by the English horn.

460
00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:18.250
And so I will play this melody and,
bid you adieu for now, but thanks so

461
00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:19.730
much for joining us for office hours.

462
00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:23.540
I hope that was a,
a helpful walk through sonata form.

463
00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:28.270
And I hope that if you liked that piece,
or that movement, i hope that you will go

464
00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:32.870
check out the rest of the symphony and,
many more symphonies by Dvorjak and,

465
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:36.910
of course, plenty of other
symphonies by many other composers,

466
00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:39.520
both of whom we've spoken
about in this class and

467
00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:43.180
others that we haven't had
the opportunity to, to discuss.

468
00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:47.781
But here we are the,
opening melody of the second

469
00:33:47.781 --> 00:33:51.572
movement of Dvojak's new world symphony.
