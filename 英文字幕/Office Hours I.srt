2
00:00:21.309 --> 00:00:26.661
[APPLAUSE] Hello, everyone and
welcome to Office Hours.

3
00:00:26.661 --> 00:00:27.880
I'm Melissa Thomas.

4
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.812
You may have seen me throughout
the Coursera discussion threads

5
00:00:31.812 --> 00:00:34.286
providing support on the Yale side, and

6
00:00:34.286 --> 00:00:38.677
today, I'm here with Professor Craig
Wright and his TA, James Park.

7
00:00:38.677 --> 00:00:42.337
And today, they're going to answer some
of the questions that you posted in

8
00:00:42.337 --> 00:00:42.996
the forums.

9
00:00:42.996 --> 00:00:44.633
So let's get started.

10
00:00:44.633 --> 00:00:53.294
[MUSIC]

11
00:00:53.294 --> 00:00:54.432
Hello, guys.

12
00:00:54.432 --> 00:00:56.690
>> Hey!
>> Thank you for sitting down with us.

13
00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:57.760
Hi, Melissa.

14
00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.710
>> Hello.
>> Good morning, Melissa.

15
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.960
Thank you for joining us.

16
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.650
>> Thank you.

17
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.100
So let's just get started with
the questions that some of

18
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.180
our students wrote in.

19
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.000
Let's start with Hock Core.

20
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.520
So Hock Core said,
I would like to take up music.

21
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.440
What do you think would be
a good instrument to start with?

22
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.170
For example, I understand that a violin
is not an easy instrument to play on,

23
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.760
because it does not have bridges,
what are your thoughts?

24
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.640
>> Well, I think the violin is
definitely a wonderful instrument.

25
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.125
I obviously will have a deep affection for
it.

26
00:01:31.125 --> 00:01:32.530
>> Mm-hm.
>> But, at the same time,

27
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.980
I can see how it might be a tricky
instrument to start off with.

28
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.814
There are a lot of nuances to,
to the instrument, even from the get-go.

29
00:01:42.814 --> 00:01:43.670
>> Mm-hm.

30
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:44.500
>> So with that said,

31
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.160
I can imagine that the piano would be
a really great instrument to begin with.

32
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.230
the, it's obviously a very different and
complex instrument in and of itself.

33
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.980
But, at the same time learning
the mechanics, I think, just getting off

34
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:06.410
the ground floor may be one of
the easier tasks for for a beginner.

35
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.410
So the piano is probably a very
good instrument to, to begin with.

36
00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.890
Another instrument that a lot of people
begin with casually is the guitar.

37
00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.860
It's a very easy to to
pick up from scratch.

38
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.280
And, obviously there is a very kind
of broad repertoire not just within

39
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.880
a classical guitar realm which is

40
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.390
a realm that actually is full of very
intricate and complex, difficult pieces.

41
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.810
But of course there's also
the popular repertoire.

42
00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:35.430
So.

43
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.720
>> Very cool.
Thank you.

44
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.350
And Craig what do you think?

45
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.380
>> I think the one instrument
I would not start with

46
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.670
is the violin [LAUGH] and the cello.

47
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.720
These are really hard.

48
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.320
These string instruments are so hard.

49
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.210
How do I know?

50
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:48.690
From painful experience.

51
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.960
Two of my four children,
one studied violin for

52
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.610
12 years, one studied cello for 12 years.

53
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.030
The parent really has to stand
with them and help them and

54
00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.030
encourage them, go to the lessons,
practice with them.

55
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.350
So unless you have genie looking over
your shoulder, or a parent close

56
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.990
at hand I recommend, as James ultimately
did, either the guitar or the piano.

57
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.240
Now, pianos are large, and
they can be very expensive.

58
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.584
But nowadays, we have the beauty of

59
00:03:15.584 --> 00:03:16.779
[MUSIC]

60
00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:18.881
this synthesizer.

61
00:03:18.881 --> 00:03:21.560
A sort of, electronic piano,
if you want to.

62
00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.520
They're much less expensive,
they fit in a smaller space.

63
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.640
So my recommendation would be, you
start out with something that gives you

64
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.910
satisfaction immediately because you play
a certain number of notes [SOUND] and

65
00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.832
you get a, a perfect sound without
having to worry about intonation or

66
00:03:34.832 --> 00:03:36.739
hand positioning or all,
this kind of thing.

67
00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.417
And not that expensive,
and you can encompass it

68
00:03:40.417 --> 00:03:45.240
more readily in whatever physical
space that you, you have at hand.

69
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.800
>> Very nice.

70
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.800
Well, there you have it, Hawk.

71
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.905
You don't have to start
with a recorder like I did.

72
00:03:48.905 --> 00:03:50.210
>> [LAUGH]
>> You have fun instruments to

73
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:51.020
choose from.

74
00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.640
All right.

75
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.940
So moving right along, we have a question
from Thomas, or Tomas Mejernick.

76
00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.280
And he asks, Professor Wright,
what is your favorite song and why?

77
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.270
And James, you can feel free to share too.

78
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.730
>> Well Melissa and Thomas, Tomas, whoo.

79
00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.380
This is one of those really
difficult questions.

80
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.463
I feel like any time I give an answer,
I immediately regret it and-

81
00:04:17.463 --> 00:04:18.846
>> [LAUGH].
>> Feel very guilty for

82
00:04:18.846 --> 00:04:22.150
all the other pieces or
songs out there that I love.

83
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.990
So what I think I'll do is
I'll probably tell you one or

84
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.590
two pieces that I've been listening
to recently that I've really enjoyed.

85
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.250
U, either getting to know or returning to.

86
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.520
And the first is the piano
quintet by Shostakovich,

87
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.000
the Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich.

88
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.680
It's a, it's a powerful work for
string quartet which would be two violins,

89
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.680
a viola and a cello as well as the piano.

90
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.230
And it's, it's a,
it's a really really amazing piece.

91
00:04:54.230 --> 00:05:01.920
It's a very emotional, it's very powerful
it has moments both of great drama and,

92
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.690
as well as kind of a playfulness, but

93
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.840
there's also kind of a,
a deep angst in the piece.

94
00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.850
It just really traverses a lot of the,

95
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.910
kind of, great emotions that
can be captured in music.

96
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:18.480
>> Yeah.

97
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.050
>> So that, yeah,

98
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.040
that's, that's kind of one that I've
been listening to a lot recently.

99
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.530
>> Thanks for sharing.

100
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.520
>> James said and, and Tomas or

101
00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:31.280
Thomas said a song but James answered
with a piece of instrumental music.

102
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.410
Which brings up the question,
What is a song?

103
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:35.460
Well if we,

104
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:40.400
we generally around the world use term
song to indicate any piece of music.

105
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.770
I suppose strictly speaking we should
just stick with song as a term for

106
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.520
pieces that have lyrics.

107
00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.470
So if we're talking about my
favorite songs our learners

108
00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.870
maybe horrified to know that I think,
well this is a beautiful song.

109
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.740
We're going to play a really gorgeous
song for you today by Schubert.

110
00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.850
But if you were to ask me
what are your favorite songs,

111
00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:04.880
I would say Adele's Rolling in the Deep,
would be one of them.

112
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.550
Hotel California, by the Eagles would be
another and maybe my all time favorite,

113
00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.321
again you'll be shocked, and
I'll probably be, be fired by saying-

114
00:06:12.321 --> 00:06:13.002
>> [LAUGH].

115
00:06:13.002 --> 00:06:16.335
>> saying this, is the City of
New Orleans by Arlo Guthrie.

116
00:06:16.335 --> 00:06:20.680
Which brings up, and we use a little
bit of that earlier in our course.

117
00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.460
And it brings up a very interesting
issue because, as a youth,

118
00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.380
I would be schlepped back and
forth between the east coast and

119
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.850
the midwest of the United States,
crossing that area.

120
00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:34.790
Going out to the farm fields of Iowa,
where my mother had come from, and

121
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.970
my grandparents had farms out there.

122
00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:43.440
So it's, acco, but what this, the point
that I'm going to here is the following.

123
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.560
That, when we listen to any piece of
music, whether its James' Shostakovich or

124
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:53.340
my City of New Orleans, the thing that
really drives that I think often times is

125
00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.640
not just the sound, its the memories
that you have associated with it.

126
00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.690
We tend to think of music being
compartmentalized over here,

127
00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:04.490
we have sound here, we have memory here,
we have emotion over here.

128
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.330
That's not the way it works in the brain.

129
00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.290
What happens is that it's this mosaic and

130
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:12.630
you have these associations
you acquire instantaneously.

131
00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:16.570
So we really can't separate out
the musical experience from

132
00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.540
the personal experience,
they are there together.

133
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.520
So I say, what is your,
what's the most moving song for you?

134
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.490
What's the most music, moving piece?

135
00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:28.270
Well, that's why I think I like these,
these particular sounds.

136
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:32.250
It's because all of the memories
that flood in at the same time.

137
00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:33.260
>> Very nice.
Thank you.

138
00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.707
All right.

139
00:07:34.707 --> 00:07:37.650
Let's see what we have next.

140
00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:39.280
We have Nicole Butt.

141
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:44.610
She says I am still confused about
the intervals, interval ratios.

142
00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:48.130
I understand that if you double a string
length, you will get a pitch that is an,

143
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.155
is one octave higher
than the original pitch.

144
00:07:51.155 --> 00:07:53.540
I.e.

145
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.700
C to the next C on the piano.

146
00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.000
I do not understand what a fifth is, or

147
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.610
how that interval relates
to the keys of a piano.

148
00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:03.810
>> So before James takes it, this one.

149
00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:06.230
Because he's got the fiddle there and
he should answer.

150
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:08.080
If if was it Nicole?

151
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:08.880
>> Nicole, yes.

152
00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.675
>> Right, if Nicole is confused,
so are we.

153
00:08:11.675 --> 00:08:13.300
>> [LAUGH]
>> In, in some ways.

154
00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.280
It's tricky, it's difficult to explain.

155
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.615
A lot of things in music,

156
00:08:16.615 --> 00:08:18.680
>> [COUGH]
>> are kind of counterintuitive and

157
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.790
difficult to explain but
we'll do, do our best.

158
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:23.000
And I think James is going to maybe he's-

159
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.360
>> All right.
>> I see his fiddle there.

160
00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.030
So he may be able to help us.

161
00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:29.420
>> Well Nicole so
actually if you have a string length,

162
00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.635
let's say let's just go with
this open string here, A.

163
00:08:32.635 --> 00:08:37.087
[SOUND] Then I'll go,
I'll move my hand up here and

164
00:08:37.087 --> 00:08:41.120
play another A that'll
be an octave higher.

165
00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:46.989
[SOUND] You see that by putting
my finger down here I've actually

166
00:08:46.989 --> 00:08:52.426
made the length of this string
now half of what it use to be.

167
00:08:52.426 --> 00:08:56.985
because it use to just resonate without
anything touching the string, so

168
00:08:56.985 --> 00:08:58.880
it was just the full length.

169
00:08:58.880 --> 00:08:59.600
And now.

170
00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.387
[MUSIC]

171
00:09:03.387 --> 00:09:09.210
So by putting my finger here, I've stopped
this half of a string from vibrating.

172
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:11.890
So now it's just vibrating
from here to the end.

173
00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:15.820
So actually the string length is
now half and the octave, well,

174
00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:19.170
we went from an A to an octave higher A.

175
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:25.080
So the string length being halved,
made the sound go higher by an octave.

176
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.810
But in a more general sense,

177
00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:31.590
intervals are the difference between
one pitch and another pitch.

178
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:35.780
So if we say, for
instance in our musical alphabet is A, B,

179
00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:41.210
C, D, E, F, G,
if we say the interval of a fifth.

180
00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:44.600
What we may, what we mean,
broadly speaking,

181
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:50.470
is the interval between one note and
five pitch excuse me, five pitches away.

182
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:54.370
So A, so
a fifth away would be one A B C D E.

183
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.710
So A to E is a fifth.

184
00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:00.700
So a second would be A to B.

185
00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.860
And a third A to C and so on.

186
00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:04.970
>> Yeah.

187
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:05.690
That's good.

188
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:12.290
Maybe if we could even James'
excellent explanation.

189
00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:15.830
But you do see that it is complicated
by looking at the keyboard.

190
00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:18.020
We may have a,
a camera on the keyboard here.

191
00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:19.396
So if we have, we,

192
00:10:19.396 --> 00:10:24.747
we can have intervals that play
sequentially, one after the other.

193
00:10:24.747 --> 00:10:25.411
[MUSIC]

194
00:10:25.411 --> 00:10:27.317
So here's a big interval,
this is the octave.

195
00:10:27.317 --> 00:10:29.343
Now I'm playing on a synthesizer but

196
00:10:29.343 --> 00:10:32.669
you have to understand that
what we have here is a just a,

197
00:10:32.669 --> 00:10:37.258
a technological replication of string
lengths, just as with James's violin.

198
00:10:37.258 --> 00:10:38.604
So here's [SOUND] one string and

199
00:10:38.604 --> 00:10:40.788
here's the string [SOUND]
twice as long down here.

200
00:10:40.788 --> 00:10:41.628
So we can see it.

201
00:10:41.628 --> 00:10:43.632
This is a fairly large [SOUND] leap.

202
00:10:43.632 --> 00:10:46.262
It's a fairly large interval,
it's an octave,

203
00:10:46.262 --> 00:10:49.495
it spans eight letter names as James said.

204
00:10:49.495 --> 00:10:51.340
Nicole referenced the fifth.

205
00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:52.850
Well let's just go up five.

206
00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:56.770
So I'm going to take, we could start on A,
it's the simplest way of doing it,

207
00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:01.830
and I'll use C-sharp to
stay in the major scale.

208
00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:02.879
A1 [SOUND], here's A, B [SOUND],
C [SOUND], D [SOUND], E [SOUND].

209
00:11:02.879 --> 00:11:03.979
[MUSIC]
One, two,

210
00:11:03.979 --> 00:11:07.380
three, four, five spend five letter names.

211
00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:09.660
We have a fifth in that fashion.

212
00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:13.170
They sounds sort of open maybe
a little bit bland if we wanted to

213
00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:16.305
spand a shorted intervalt.

214
00:11:16.305 --> 00:11:19.210
[SOUND] We could play them sequencialy we
can play them together than we get one,

215
00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:20.291
two, three.

216
00:11:20.291 --> 00:11:22.261
The third sounds lovely.

217
00:11:22.261 --> 00:11:24.471
If we want to, reverse that a little bit.

218
00:11:24.471 --> 00:11:26.579
[MUSIC]
One, two, three, four, five, six.

219
00:11:26.579 --> 00:11:27.613
We get a sixth.

220
00:11:27.613 --> 00:11:29.911
[MUSIC]
That also sounds lovely.

221
00:11:29.911 --> 00:11:31.075
Interval of the second.

222
00:11:31.075 --> 00:11:32.281
[MUSIC]
Just one, two.

223
00:11:32.281 --> 00:11:33.498
Well it sounds like a great idea.

224
00:11:33.498 --> 00:11:34.450
[MUSIC]
But when you put

225
00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:36.420
them together they're sort of dissonant.

226
00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:39.040
That's the close together second, and

227
00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.058
because they tend to be close
together they are dissonant.

228
00:11:41.058 --> 00:11:42.363
>> Mm-hm.

229
00:11:42.363 --> 00:11:44.680
Thank you.

230
00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.800
I hope that clears everything up for
you, Nicole.

231
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:51.470
All right and we have another question.

232
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:53.300
A more, another clarifying question.

233
00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:58.650
I would appreciate some clarification
on how to recognize modulation.

234
00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:02.790
How do we know when the music
has switched to a different key?

235
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:05.380
Says Cory Stress, Stresinger.

236
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.775
And he also says, this is a great course.

237
00:12:07.775 --> 00:12:11.725
>> [LAUGH] it, it's funny we get,
why don't you give us an easy question?

238
00:12:11.725 --> 00:12:12.888
[CROSSTALK].
>> [LAUGH].

239
00:12:12.888 --> 00:12:16.830
>> And this one is an easy one to answer,
but it's hard to hear.

240
00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:18.450
It's really hard to hear.

241
00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:19.920
And when I go to concerts,

242
00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:25.800
I can genuinely speaking sometimes
here the modulation is happening.

243
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.810
And I'm not absolutely sure that this
should be the, the most important thing in

244
00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:32.800
one's listening experience,
it's sort of in the background.

245
00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:37.500
It's maybe a graduate level question or
graduate level experience.

246
00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.660
This whole business of modulation.

247
00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:43.040
I think one can enjoy music and
experience it with,

248
00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:47.670
to its fullest without necessarily
knowing that it was a modulation.

249
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:53.190
But let's stick with the question here,
and a modulation is just a change of key.

250
00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:58.350
I think even Schoenberg said it's sort
of like a change of musical scenery.

251
00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:00.450
Well, we're going to change the scenery.

252
00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:02.430
Now, I, I may have done this, and

253
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:07.230
we may have done this very briefly,
but let's review modulation.

254
00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:10.270
We can a modulation
means you're somewhere.

255
00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:13.450
You're established in the territory,
a tonal territory.

256
00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:15.890
So we're going to establish
the tonal territory.

257
00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:18.024
I like to work with C because
it has no sharps and flats.

258
00:13:18.024 --> 00:13:25.992
[MUSIC]

259
00:13:25.992 --> 00:13:30.891
So there we are, firmly here in C, but
supposing we wanted to move somewhere,

260
00:13:30.891 --> 00:13:35.197
well then what you do is you take
a note that's not part of the scale and

261
00:13:35.197 --> 00:13:36.251
you inflect it.

262
00:13:36.251 --> 00:13:38.015
[MUSIC]

263
00:13:38.015 --> 00:13:38.958
Okay, so we were here.

264
00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:39.929
[MUSIC]
And then suddenly,

265
00:13:39.929 --> 00:13:40.894
we're going to add this note.

266
00:13:40.894 --> 00:13:43.949
And then that takes us over to here.

267
00:13:43.949 --> 00:13:46.537
And then a composer would be quick to

268
00:13:46.537 --> 00:13:53.449
[MUSIC]

269
00:13:53.449 --> 00:13:55.670
to establish that as a new, tonality.

270
00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:59.340
So now we've traveled to a new land,
a new tonal land.

271
00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:02.246
But after awhile we play there and
maybe that gets boring.

272
00:14:02.246 --> 00:14:05.627
[MUSIC]

273
00:14:05.627 --> 00:14:09.028
And maybe we need another change
of scenery so here we sit.

274
00:14:09.028 --> 00:14:16.784
[MUSIC]

275
00:14:16.784 --> 00:14:19.966
We've established another
territory over there.

276
00:14:19.966 --> 00:14:23.065
They happen quickly in, in music.

277
00:14:23.065 --> 00:14:25.990
There is a moment of inflection which,
oh that was nice.

278
00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:31.650
I'm not sure that knowing, oh gee, that
was a modulation, helps us all that much.

279
00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:34.620
But technically, that's what's
going on through the modulation.

280
00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:35.180
>> Okay.

281
00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:38.440
Do you have anything to add, James?

282
00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:43.120
>> I think that that's that's, that's a
very good introduction to how to kind of,

283
00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.190
basically hear modulations.

284
00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:48.550
One thing that comes to mind is that.

285
00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:49.745
In a lot of pop songs.

286
00:14:49.745 --> 00:14:51.880
>> Mm-hm.
>> Sometimes towards the end

287
00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:56.910
you might actually hear
that there's rise in,

288
00:14:56.910 --> 00:15:00.900
in the, in the pitch and in,
in pretty much in the entire song.

289
00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:04.400
Sometimes by a half step,
sometimes by a whole step.

290
00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.850
The distinction between those two is
not what's necessarily important, for

291
00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:08.990
this, moment.

292
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:13.870
But, when you hear the pitch
kind of rising and

293
00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:15.670
you hear all the music around it kind of,

294
00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:21.720
almost, feeling like it went up,
we often call that a pump up modulation.

295
00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:27.070
And it, it feels like the music is getting
more intense and it feels like the energy

296
00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:32.000
has has risen simply by all of the music
and the melody, the vocal melody all

297
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.460
moving up by that same interval,
either a half step or a whole step.

298
00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:40.790
So that's actually another really easy
kind of moment to hear as a modulation and

299
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:43.200
it often happens towards
the end of pop songs.

300
00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.660
When, if it does happen at all.

301
00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:45.420
>> Oh, good to know.
I know I'll,

302
00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:46.510
I'll be on the lookout for those.

303
00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:49.065
>> Yeah, usually that, that's usually
where they're running out of gas.

304
00:15:49.065 --> 00:15:51.740
[LAUGH] In other words they've got
this great idea, you've milked it for

305
00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:53.460
three minutes, we have no more ideas.

306
00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:54.160
What are we going to do?

307
00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.070
My gosh, we gotta fill this track up.

308
00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:58.400
Oh, let's pump it up.

309
00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.020
>> Yes.
>> And, and, and

310
00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:01.080
energize it just,
I never heard that before.

311
00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.200
Pump up modulation.

312
00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:02.830
>> Yeah.
>> That's cool.

313
00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:03.770
>> I never heard it either.

314
00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:04.300
Good to know.

315
00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:09.850
All right, and our last question
was posted by an anonymous user.

316
00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:12.100
It says, thank you for a great course.

317
00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:16.910
I have a question about overtones,
specifically in barbershop singing.

318
00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:20.380
Which overtone am I hearing
when I hear that ring or

319
00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:24.890
extra voice in an a capella barbershop,
and why?

320
00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:27.820
Is it always the tonic, or
is it sometimes the fifth?

321
00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.760
>> I think, if I could take this one,

322
00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.660
I don't know I, and I have never,
eh, sung barbershop.

323
00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.740
Eh, I don't, actually I have, but

324
00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:40.505
it was so long ago that I
forgot now that I ever did.

325
00:16:40.505 --> 00:16:41.864
[LAUGH] I suspect what you're hearing

326
00:16:41.864 --> 00:16:42.517
[MUSIC]

327
00:16:42.517 --> 00:16:45.523
let's say we have a,
we have an end of the song that goes here.

328
00:16:45.523 --> 00:16:46.054
[MUSIC]
I

329
00:16:46.054 --> 00:16:48.518
suspect what you're hearing
is this kind of sound.

330
00:16:48.518 --> 00:16:49.621
[MUSIC]

331
00:16:49.621 --> 00:16:51.750
Very faintly up above there.

332
00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:54.180
It's probably the fifth degree.

333
00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.870
I hear this a lot, actually,
in orchestral scores and

334
00:16:56.870 --> 00:17:01.940
James is an orchestral player
with the EF Symphony Orchestra.

335
00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:05.640
And oftentimes,
it's the brasses that are sitting there,

336
00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:09.660
you'll have a horn I'm just sort of
sitting up where the basic tone,

337
00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:12.570
bam, is up here, and
James is probably down here.

338
00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:14.648
Maybe a trumpet or a french horn is

339
00:17:14.648 --> 00:17:16.449
[MUSIC].

340
00:17:16.449 --> 00:17:17.400
sort of faintly.

341
00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.450
And that's what I hear as a ring.

342
00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:23.680
And James thought about that?

343
00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:29.720
>> No I think that In barber shop singing
I don't have a ton of experience with it.

344
00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:34.370
But I think it's very possible that what
you're hearing is either the overtone of

345
00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:37.299
the, of the fifth, like, Craig said.

346
00:17:37.299 --> 00:17:42.530
And maybe depending on what part of
the harmony you you are singing,

347
00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:44.130
you may also be hearing pentatonic.

348
00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:49.760
Sometimes you may be just hearing the note
that you're singing kind of resonating,

349
00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:53.370
not only throughout your body, but,
you know, kind of out and into, out in

350
00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:57.915
the air just because you're producing
this, so much of the sound yourself.

351
00:17:57.915 --> 00:17:58.750
>> Mm-hm.

352
00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:01.290
That what you're hearing may
just be some sort of, kind of,

353
00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:05.110
amplification of your own pitch, but,
unfortunately, I don't really have much

354
00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:10.830
more expertise in, in barbershops,
and, to really say more beyond that.

355
00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:12.010
>> Fair enough.

356
00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:15.380
All right.
Well, do you guys want to play a little

357
00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:20.520
tune to close this office hour session or
add anything else?

358
00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.200
>> Well there is one thing
that we want to talk about.

359
00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:23.370
>> Yeah.
Sure.

360
00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:25.605
>> That we think might be helpful.

361
00:18:25.605 --> 00:18:26.430
>> Mm-hm.

362
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:29.224
>> For our students with respect to meter.

363
00:18:29.224 --> 00:18:30.806
>> Mm-hm.

364
00:18:30.806 --> 00:18:34.770
>> So one of the tricky
things about meter is that

365
00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:42.400
the meter is not always present in
the most visceral sense in music.

366
00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:47.690
The Satie the Gymnopédies by Erik Satie.

367
00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:49.525
>> Mm.
>> That was used in one of the videos.

368
00:18:49.525 --> 00:18:51.560
>> Mm-hm.
>> Is actually a great example of a,

369
00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:55.130
of a piece that has meter for sure.

370
00:18:55.130 --> 00:19:00.615
But its not always ever present
kind of on the palpable horizon.

371
00:19:00.615 --> 00:19:03.030
>> Mm-hm
>> And we'll get to that in a moment.

372
00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:05.810
But the, the important thing to
remember about meter is that it

373
00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:07.980
organizes musical time.

374
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:11.250
In regular time we organize music,
I'm sorry.

375
00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:16.370
We organize time with seconds and
minutes in hours and, and so forth.

376
00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:22.262
But in musical time, we usually organize
things in terms of beat patterns.

377
00:19:22.262 --> 00:19:23.295
>> Mm-hm.

378
00:19:23.295 --> 00:19:27.500
>> So, you're not necessarily going to
hear the beat always when you listen to

379
00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.490
a piece of music but

380
00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:32.890
there will be underlying beat
structure to help organize the time.

381
00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:40.030
So for instance, in duple meter,
we'll have one, two, one, two, one, two.

382
00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:41.575
Even if the music isn't doing that.

383
00:19:41.575 --> 00:19:42.386
>> Mm-hm.

384
00:19:42.386 --> 00:19:50.018
>> For instance, let's think of goodness,
let's think of a tune.

385
00:19:50.018 --> 00:19:52.457
How about let's do Happy Birthday.

386
00:19:52.457 --> 00:19:53.153
You ready?

387
00:19:53.153 --> 00:20:00.146
So
[MUSIC]

388
00:20:00.146 --> 00:20:00.912
So this is three.

389
00:20:00.912 --> 00:20:09.584
[MUSIC]

390
00:20:09.584 --> 00:20:14.010
So Happy Birthday is actually
an interesting decision on my part to use.

391
00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:18.770
Because it actually starts with a pick up,
which basically means it's kind of

392
00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:23.920
an additional amount of music
that precedes our downbeat.

393
00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:31.800
Happy birthday to you,
happy birthday to you.

394
00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:35.520
So, do you see how every time I move
my arm like this, this is a beat.

395
00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:39.150
This is how we conduct triple meters,
so one, two three.

396
00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:41.730
One, two, three.

397
00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:45.240
So happy birthday to you.

398
00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:48.050
Happy birthday to you.

399
00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:52.840
So even when we're saying you,
you is being held.

400
00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.220
>> Right.
>> When you just say you,

401
00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:55.500
we don't go you, you.

402
00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:57.455
>> Right.
>> Happy birthday-

403
00:20:57.455 --> 00:20:58.895
>> [LAUGH]
>> To you, you.

404
00:20:58.895 --> 00:21:00.610
>> [LAUGH]
>> But even though we're holding-

405
00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:01.550
>> Right.
>> You.

406
00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:03.275
Through two beats its there.

407
00:21:03.275 --> 00:21:04.600
>> Mm-hm.
>> It's always there that's why

408
00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.525
we have this kind of triple meter.

409
00:21:06.525 --> 00:21:07.630
>> Mm-hm.
>> The beats are always there in

410
00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:08.380
the background.

411
00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:11.210
So maybe the way that we should
quickly demonstrate this

412
00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:16.650
is by playing maybe an except
of two triple meter pieces.

413
00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:17.490
>> Okay.

414
00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:22.630
>> That way we can get a feel for how how
the beats are operating in the background.

415
00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:28.330
So this is one that we were
playing as folks were coming in,

416
00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:34.130
because it does have a very clear pattern,
where we know

417
00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:40.525
where the beat is by this sort
of accompaniment underneath.

418
00:21:40.525 --> 00:21:43.640
One, two, three, one, two, three.

419
00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:46.710
And I love this piece because you
get this strong downbeat there.

420
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:50.110
That really sets up the meter
as James was saying.

421
00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:54.400
And then we subdivide it with
other beats and then we have hits.

422
00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.510
I like to think of them as hits.

423
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:57.820
So hit, hit, hit, hit.

424
00:21:57.820 --> 00:21:59.330
Hit, hit, hit, hit.

425
00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:00.760
Hit, hit, hit, hit.

426
00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:04.410
With a big hit coming on the down beat and
all the little ones after.

427
00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:08.530
>> And all those little hits, hits or
articulations, that's rhythm.

428
00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:10.080
Those are the surface rhythms.

429
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:14.590
So the meter is the underlying kind
of organizing beat pattern and

430
00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:16.340
that will, that's stable.

431
00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:18.150
Its like seconds.

432
00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:22.660
And then well there's not necessarily
a good analogue in the kind of minutes and

433
00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:27.680
seconds metaphor here for the rhythm.

434
00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.560
But the rhythm obviously is,

435
00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:34.420
it is the kind of surface articulations
that make the music itself.

436
00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:35.820
>> Okay, so, a quick take on this.

437
00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:36.478
Here's our downbeat.

438
00:22:36.478 --> 00:22:37.952
[MUSIC]

439
00:22:37.952 --> 00:22:42.969
Two, three, two, three.

440
00:22:42.969 --> 00:22:44.557
Two, three.

441
00:22:44.557 --> 00:22:54.557
[MUSIC].

442
00:24:06.246 --> 00:24:07.338
>> Very beautiful.

443
00:24:07.338 --> 00:24:08.081
[LAUGH].

444
00:24:08.081 --> 00:24:12.690
>> So that's I think a very
straightforward example of triple meter.

445
00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:15.332
And you can kind of here
that because especially in

446
00:24:15.332 --> 00:24:18.369
the left handed piano a very
regular you know movement.

447
00:24:18.369 --> 00:24:19.053
You know, of.

448
00:24:19.053 --> 00:24:22.665
[MUSIC]

449
00:24:22.665 --> 00:24:28.167
So next I think Craig will play
the Gymnopedie again which is by

450
00:24:28.167 --> 00:24:32.937
Erik Satie and this one is
a little bit more tricky because

451
00:24:32.937 --> 00:24:37.827
especially in the beginning you're
only going to hear two hits.

452
00:24:37.827 --> 00:24:38.663
It's just going to be

453
00:24:38.663 --> 00:24:46.025
[MUSIC]

454
00:24:46.025 --> 00:24:51.257
So when you have only two hits it might
feel like there are only two beats

455
00:24:51.257 --> 00:24:57.350
happening, but actually underlying
those two hits are three steady beats.

456
00:24:57.350 --> 00:25:01.220
So what I'll do is I'll conduct
as we're hearing this so

457
00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:05.453
that you can hear all of those beats
in conjunction with just the two hits.

458
00:25:05.453 --> 00:25:08.481
So, maybe.

459
00:25:08.481 --> 00:25:10.025
[LAUGH] That's it.

460
00:25:10.025 --> 00:25:20.025
[MUSIC]

461
00:26:05.276 --> 00:26:06.054
Yeah.

462
00:26:06.054 --> 00:26:07.018
>> Great.

463
00:26:07.018 --> 00:26:09.356
Well, no one asked what
my favorite song was, but

464
00:26:09.356 --> 00:26:11.200
that happens to be one of my favorites.

465
00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.453
>> Oh, it's a lovely piece.

466
00:26:12.453 --> 00:26:16.790
>> Yes.
Nobody's ever heard much of Eric Satie.

467
00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:19.720
I guess he's a sort of
one-hit wonder in a sense.

468
00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:23.645
Occasionally that happens where
it's like the inventor of velcro-

469
00:26:23.645 --> 00:26:24.840
>> [LAUGH]
>> or something,

470
00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:29.540
well I have one great idea, and everybody
loves this piece by Eric Satie but

471
00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:32.780
you ask, who wrote it, who's Eric Satie.

472
00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:34.080
>> Right, right.

473
00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:35.990
Yeah, it is a beautiful song for sure.

474
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.510
>> Yeah.

475
00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:37.010
>> All right.

476
00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:39.160
Well anything else?

477
00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:42.450
>> No, I think that'll do it for,
for today.

478
00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:43.510
We've got two more-

479
00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:44.920
>> Yes.
>> Weeks of classes and

480
00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:48.242
then we'll come back for
another exciting office hour and

481
00:26:48.242 --> 00:26:51.305
we'll get to play our office
hour with jingle again-

482
00:26:51.305 --> 00:26:52.015
>> Yes!

483
00:26:52.015 --> 00:26:53.290
>> [LAUGH].
>> That's our favorite
