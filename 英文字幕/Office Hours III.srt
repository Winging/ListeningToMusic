[MUSIC]

2
00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:14.199
All right wasn't that beautiful.

3
00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:19.778
We'll, I'm sad to say this is our
last Office Hour for this class.

4
00:01:19.778 --> 00:01:24.279
But I wanted to share some really cool
stats that you might find interesting

5
00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:25.860
about this course.

6
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:33.190
So since the intro to classical music has
launched, the lectures for this course

7
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:39.560
have been viewed over 1.4 million
times and that's pretty impressive.

8
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.060
As for the quizzes 3,
375,000 quizzes have been submitted.

9
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.871
And for the forums,
there have been 8,000 forum posts.

10
00:01:49.871 --> 00:01:52.381
And I think those are pretty
remarkable numbers, and

11
00:01:52.381 --> 00:01:56.020
we're glad you're enjoying the course and
engaging in it as much as you are.

12
00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.390
So, with out further ado, let's just get
into some questions that you guys had.

13
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:01.734
Hi, Craig. Hi, James. >> Hi.

14
00:02:01.734 --> 00:02:02.418
>> Hi, Lois.

15
00:02:02.418 --> 00:02:03.579
Hi, everybody.

16
00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:04.590
>> All right.

17
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.460
So, James,
this question we're going to aim at you.

18
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.012
>> Okay, sure.

19
00:02:09.012 --> 00:02:13.639
>> [LAUGH] So this student asks, at this
point, I'm not sure how much material,

20
00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:18.028
contemporary, classical music will be
included in the upcoming lectures.

21
00:02:18.028 --> 00:02:23.450
So, I want to be sure to get some insight
into this music before the class finishes,

22
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.960
to that end,
I have the following question.

23
00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.911
So, this is a four part question, but
I'm going to break it down one-by-one.

24
00:02:28.911 --> 00:02:29.433
>> Okay.

25
00:02:29.433 --> 00:02:32.016
Sure.
>> So the first is, what are the main

26
00:02:32.016 --> 00:02:37.800
trends in contemporary classic, classical
music of the last, say, 25 to 30 years?

27
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.950
>> Oh, that's a good question.

28
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.810
I'm going to start my answer with kind
of a cop-out, which is to say that.

29
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.760
When you spend the time that I'm
spending on a very particular focus for

30
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.420
which for me right now is my dissertation
on the American composer Samuel Barber,

31
00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:03.240
who is kind of a mid 20th century figure,
sometimes you don't always have your head

32
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.720
plugged into the more present day or
even the last couple of decades.

33
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.900
So so I, I'll preface it with that,
and, and apologize that I don't know,

34
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.370
necessarily all of the kind of big
trends that have happened in the last,

35
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.850
you know,
I guess since maybe the 80s or so.

36
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.680
But I can say, broadly speaking,
that over the 20th century we've seen

37
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.670
some very interesting occurrences in,
in, in, art music,

38
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.810
in classical music, which is to say
there was this kind of big bang,

39
00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.440
maybe let's call it, a big bang of,
of kind of aesthetic options.

40
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.690
And so
you see composers who have stayed kind of

41
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.910
closer to the path of art music as it
has been given up to the 20th century.

42
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.840
And you start to see composers who,
who go in a totally opposite direction

43
00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.770
some of whom completely relinquish,
for example, acoustic instruments and

44
00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:06.078
deal only with electronic sounds and,
and music generated by computers.

45
00:04:06.078 --> 00:04:10.179
And then you see a lot of the in between,
and I think the in between maybe is

46
00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:14.227
where a lot of the music of the last
couple decades has has resided.

47
00:04:14.227 --> 00:04:15.189
>> Mm-hm.

48
00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:20.754
>> Composers who are kind of at home
writing music that uses acoustic

49
00:04:20.754 --> 00:04:25.619
instruments, digital instruments,
digital sounds.

50
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.080
Sometimes they even use recordings,
of things out in the world.

51
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.660
A, a composer might go out and
make a recording of,

52
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.585
like a street noises from a busy city and
then incorporate that into their piece.

53
00:04:39.585 --> 00:04:44.064
So while I can't necessarily
pin down the important trends,

54
00:04:44.064 --> 00:04:48.991
I think maybe what that speaks to is that
there have just been so many trends in,

55
00:04:48.991 --> 00:04:53.495
in every direction in, in the 20th and
into the 21st century.

56
00:04:53.495 --> 00:04:54.691
So.
>> Okay.

57
00:04:54.691 --> 00:04:56.294
Well thank you, we appreciate that answer.

58
00:04:56.294 --> 00:04:57.953
I don't, I don't think it's a cop-out.

59
00:04:57.953 --> 00:04:59.285
[LAUGH].

60
00:04:59.285 --> 00:05:02.790
So the second part of this
person's question is.

61
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.120
Who are the key composers of
this period to take note of?

62
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.540
Say, maybe there's a half dozen or so?

63
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.970
>> Well, let's see here.

64
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.660
Once again this is actually,

65
00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.512
this is probably the most dangerous
question that one might get.

66
00:05:18.512 --> 00:05:21.146
[LAUGH].
And and I'm going to say that I am,

67
00:05:21.146 --> 00:05:26.972
I am in no position to declare, you know,
any composers who are the ones to watch or

68
00:05:26.972 --> 00:05:31.547
the ones who are going to make it through,
whatever that means.

69
00:05:31.547 --> 00:05:36.168
If history has taught us
anything it's that it's almost

70
00:05:36.168 --> 00:05:40.140
impossible to do that right now anyhow.

71
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.430
You know,
you think of someone like Bach who,

72
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:47.320
who very easily could have faded
completely away right after he died.

73
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.920
I mean obviously the cultural differences
and, and, and whatnot are in play.

74
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:58.240
But I mean if someone like Bach, who has
such a status today could have faded away,

75
00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.580
I mean, you know, after 1750 who am I to
say anything about the composers today?

76
00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.245
However, I can give you a couple of names
of composers that maybe I've noticed.

77
00:06:06.245 --> 00:06:06.950
>> Mm-hm.

78
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.904
>> Out in the world and, you know,
I, I'm in no way endorsing or

79
00:06:10.904 --> 00:06:16.046
saying that they are the luminaries but,
you know, they're up there, I mean.

80
00:06:16.046 --> 00:06:20.481
John Adams is obviously a big
name in the scene right now, and

81
00:06:20.481 --> 00:06:25.823
Philip Glass there's a Finnish
composer named Einojuhani Rautavaara.

82
00:06:25.823 --> 00:06:28.575
>> Hm.
>> Who has a lot of his music performed

83
00:06:28.575 --> 00:06:32.845
actually the former conductor of
the LA Phil Esa-Pekka Salonen,

84
00:06:32.845 --> 00:06:36.608
is also very a well-respected composer.

85
00:06:36.608 --> 00:06:40.168
Jennifer Higden is actually
an American composer who is,

86
00:06:40.168 --> 00:06:45.378
who is writing a lot of music these days
and, and is getting a lot of performances.

87
00:06:45.378 --> 00:06:49.086
There is a composer actually
from Yale from the he,

88
00:06:49.086 --> 00:06:54.181
he actually was an undergraduate here and
then also got a degree in composition from

89
00:06:54.181 --> 00:06:59.770
the music school who I understand is
doing very well, his name is Timo Andres.

90
00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:00.832
>> Okay.

91
00:07:00.832 --> 00:07:07.815
>> There's another Finnish composer,
I think her last name is Serio.

92
00:07:07.815 --> 00:07:12.750
I'm sorry that my Finnish pronunciation
is probably absolutely terrible but

93
00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.720
she is also another prolific composer.

94
00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.400
I think she's had some operas produced

95
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.801
possibly even at
the Metropolitan in New York so.

96
00:07:20.801 --> 00:07:22.486
>> Mm-hm.
>> I mean, there are,

97
00:07:22.486 --> 00:07:25.485
there are lots of composers out there are,

98
00:07:25.485 --> 00:07:30.567
our is another big name he's Estonian,
so these composers

99
00:07:30.567 --> 00:07:35.672
are coming from all over the world and
Ton Dun is a Chinese Composer.

100
00:07:35.672 --> 00:07:36.974
>> Okay.
>> So anyway, yeah,

101
00:07:36.974 --> 00:07:40.210
these are just names that I've
kind of seen here and there.

102
00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:44.284
And if you're interested in any of them,
please you know, go out and, and,

103
00:07:44.284 --> 00:07:47.233
find their music and, and
see their performances, and

104
00:07:47.233 --> 00:07:51.460
hear their performances, and, you know,
form an opinion for yourself.

105
00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:52.971
>> That's great.
I mean, it sounds like you rattled off

106
00:07:52.971 --> 00:07:53.890
more than half a dozen.

107
00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:54.586
[LAUGH].
>> Oh.

108
00:07:54.586 --> 00:07:55.573
Maybe, maybe seven.

109
00:07:55.573 --> 00:07:56.153
>> So, that's, that's good news.

110
00:07:56.153 --> 00:07:59.183
[LAUGH] And Craig,
did you have anything to add that, or?

111
00:07:59.183 --> 00:08:01.313
>> No.
After James' fine answer, I,

112
00:08:01.313 --> 00:08:03.687
I wouldn't begin to go anywhere near that.

113
00:08:03.687 --> 00:08:04.355
[LAUGH].

114
00:08:04.355 --> 00:08:08.387
I guess one obvious take away, if you
want to be a great contemporary kentuk,

115
00:08:08.387 --> 00:08:11.628
con, compen, composure,
move to Estonia or Finland.

116
00:08:11.628 --> 00:08:14.214
That would be [LAUGH] that
would be one good thing to do.

117
00:08:14.214 --> 00:08:17.457
The other thought is that we probably,
it probably be 25,

118
00:08:17.457 --> 00:08:21.673
30 years before we have really sense,
fore, before the general populous.

119
00:08:21.673 --> 00:08:24.420
So society has a chance
to evaluate all this, and

120
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:28.507
it all begins to shake out into some
kind of pecking orders as to, to who,

121
00:08:28.507 --> 00:08:33.720
in retrospect, we thought was really the,
the essential, influential composer.

122
00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:34.635
So it may be too soon.

123
00:08:34.635 --> 00:08:35.230
>> Mm-hm.

124
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.945
>> To really make any definitive de,
determinations.

125
00:08:37.945 --> 00:08:38.542
>> Mm-hm.

126
00:08:38.542 --> 00:08:39.937
Okay.
Fair enough.

127
00:08:39.937 --> 00:08:45.960
All right let's move on to the third part
of this question, this big question,

128
00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:50.760
and the student asks, what are three
pieces of contemporary classical music

129
00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:56.560
that you feel could become staples
of the overall classical repertoire?

130
00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:01.890
Well.
>> You're, you're the 20th century guy,

131
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:02.540
21st century guy.

132
00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.130
>> Yeah.
I don't know.

133
00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:09.080
I think I'm going to, I'm going to
pass on answering that question

134
00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.920
by the letter of the,
of the law as it were.

135
00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:17.880
I have no idea what pieces
are going to make it to the canon.

136
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:18.520
>> Yeah.

137
00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:22.812
>> I would say that once again, I mean
any of the composers that I just named.

138
00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:25.783
I think you, you should check out their
music and kind of, see what you like,

139
00:09:25.783 --> 00:09:26.714
see what's out there.

140
00:09:26.714 --> 00:09:28.664
I mean, there are so
many names that I, I-.

141
00:09:28.664 --> 00:09:29.315
>> Mm-hm.

142
00:09:29.315 --> 00:09:33.647
>> Regret that I haven't mentioned either
because they're not coming to mind, or

143
00:09:33.647 --> 00:09:35.280
just there are too many to name.

144
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.100
But maybe one easy way to kind of,

145
00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:43.810
get your feet wet is to look at if
you live near a major orchestra,

146
00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:46.930
just kind of look at their program for
this season.

147
00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:48.980
Or for last season or for next season.

148
00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:53.680
And see if there are names of
composers who are living or

149
00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.920
who might have just recently passed.

150
00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.420
And see what they're playing and,
and, and, look it up and,

151
00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:59.585
and hear what they sound like.

152
00:09:59.585 --> 00:10:01.380
>> Mm-hm.
>> And just kind of and

153
00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.090
can figure it out for yourself.

154
00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:04.990
Your guess is as good as mine,
to some degree,

155
00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:08.550
what, what pieces of today will,
will kind of live on.

156
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:09.230
>> Right.

157
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:10.840
I'm sure that's hard to tell.

158
00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:14.600
Well, last but not least for
this person's questions,

159
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:19.660
how about some tips on listening to and
appreciating this music,

160
00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:25.590
which many find difficult unlovely,
overtly intellectual, et cetera.

161
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:30.180
>> Well my first tip would be to go
listen to it a lot, get used to it,

162
00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:36.070
maybe it's it's something like spinach
that you have to become acclimated to it,

163
00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:37.580
to develop a taste for it.

164
00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.780
[LAUGH] Well may maybe if
it's Brussels sprouts or

165
00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:42.807
spinach you you don't develop a taste for
it, I'm not really sure.

166
00:10:42.807 --> 00:10:46.120
[LAUGH] But I found that with say
say the music of Arnold Schoenberg.

167
00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:50.910
If I take a piece and play, initially
I sit there playing it, I don't know,

168
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:51.840
why would I want to do this?

169
00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.240
And you play it a couple of times.

170
00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.880
Wow, you know, I, I understand this.

171
00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.990
I'm getting, kind of getting, you sort
of go off into your own world and that.

172
00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:02.250
Though, that world becomes
a new context for you.

173
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:04.050
So that would be my recommendation.

174
00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:08.410
If, that if you engage something that
initially seems off-putting, maybe engage

175
00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:12.240
it a lot, so that it becomes part of you
and you're more comfortable with it.

176
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.620
Actually if you stop and think about it,

177
00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:19.540
that's how any sort of creating a
progressive event or happen with society.

178
00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:23.470
The box is here somebody comes along and
moves the box slightly, everybody

179
00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:27.185
initially objects then everybody climbs
in the box and we're in a new place.

180
00:11:27.185 --> 00:11:28.510
>> Mm-hm.
>> And then somebody else comes along with

181
00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:30.830
a new idea we all have
to get used to that, so

182
00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:34.900
by listening to something frequently
they were just getting used to it.

183
00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:35.640
Okay.

184
00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.020
I can appreciate that, James.

185
00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:37.600
>> Yeah.

186
00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:41.300
>> I think that in addition
to everything Craig said,

187
00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:46.160
my word of advice would be to think also,

188
00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:52.640
about the context, and, and
kind of, the terms of the piece.

189
00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.450
I'll give you an example
of what I mean here.

190
00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:56.950
So let's run with Schaumburg,
for instance.

191
00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:03.230
At first a lot of his music can
certainly sound challenging,

192
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:07.595
discordant, and
incomprehensible, whatever.

193
00:12:07.595 --> 00:12:10.675
You can append whatever
adjective you'd like.

194
00:12:10.675 --> 00:12:15.795
However, if you think
about it as being part

195
00:12:15.795 --> 00:12:19.805
of a dialog with other
composers out there, and

196
00:12:19.805 --> 00:12:24.660
part of a dialog with the music
that he kind of inherited.

197
00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:29.160
>> From centuries before, or even decades
before, or even a couple years before.

198
00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:34.160
You think about it as a relationship
between where he's seeing himself coming

199
00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.520
from, and then you start to see
what he's trying to challenge.

200
00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:41.590
It's it could be that way with modern art
as well, I mean sometimes I think to,

201
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:45.090
especially when I was younger, I think to
myself if I go to a modern art museum and

202
00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:47.730
think I could have done that, but
that's not the point to some degree.

203
00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:50.870
It's not or at least in, in visual
art I don't think it's necessarily

204
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.240
the point that you could have done it.

205
00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:56.240
It's, it's about the, the frame of
reference or what, what are the terms that

206
00:12:58.495 --> 00:13:03.425
that, what are the terms that define
what is, what the artwork is doing for

207
00:13:03.425 --> 00:13:05.485
itself or for
its relationship with other works.

208
00:13:05.485 --> 00:13:09.915
So with Shernburg if the music jumps
in weird ways and sounds wacky or

209
00:13:09.915 --> 00:13:11.267
if the chords don't sound very good.

210
00:13:11.267 --> 00:13:16.107
Good, you kind of have to also think about
what is Schoenberg trying to play with?

211
00:13:16.107 --> 00:13:20.191
Like, i, i, if we're used to a nice
melody that just goes [SOUND] and

212
00:13:20.191 --> 00:13:22.068
Schoenberg goes [SOUND] right?

213
00:13:22.068 --> 00:13:27.084
The idea then is like, he's kind of
putting you in a position to, to hear that

214
00:13:27.084 --> 00:13:32.440
rhythm, more traditional or kind of
beautiful music as as the background.

215
00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.890
>> Okay.
>> It sits in, in dialog with it.

216
00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:36.590
And so
maybe that's a way to kind of understand

217
00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:40.370
where this music is positioning
itself with respect to other music.

218
00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:40.957
>> Okay.
>> Yeah.

219
00:13:40.957 --> 00:13:41.629
Good, very good point.

220
00:13:41.629 --> 00:13:42.488
Very good point.

221
00:13:42.488 --> 00:13:43.022
>> Yeah.

222
00:13:43.022 --> 00:13:43.788
Very good point.

223
00:13:43.788 --> 00:13:46.730
All right, well,
we have some questions here.

224
00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:50.810
Actually, a very interesting questions,
question.

225
00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:53.290
This person says, greetings Craig.

226
00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:56.230
I am an American living in China.

227
00:13:56.230 --> 00:14:00.288
I learn to read music, musical notes
as letters, A, B, C et cetera.

228
00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:05.000
My wife is Chinese and
learned doe, re, me et cetera.

229
00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.660
We both play violin, to a certain extent.

230
00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:12.800
I've been playing longer, and
I try to each her new music, but

231
00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:16.650
it is all a bit confusing,
especially sharps and flats.

232
00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:18.908
Do you have any advice for her?

233
00:14:18.908 --> 00:14:20.743
>> Advice?

234
00:14:20.743 --> 00:14:22.624
No other than to,

235
00:14:22.624 --> 00:14:28.455
to just get used to it [LAUGH]
because it's been around a long time.

236
00:14:28.455 --> 00:14:32.265
That particular dichotomy and
this used to be something I would teach.

237
00:14:32.265 --> 00:14:36.885
I think James was actually in the course
at one point, our medieval T&A class where

238
00:14:36.885 --> 00:14:41.010
we, we dealt with all of these, all of
these issues of music theory goes back.

239
00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:42.890
It's more than a 1,000 years old.

240
00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:45.635
Initially around the year 1000,
we had this system of-

241
00:14:45.635 --> 00:14:47.424
[MUSIC]

242
00:14:47.424 --> 00:14:50.030
A, B, C, D, E, F, G and so on.

243
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:54.560
Then somebody discovered well,
that's confusing because at two spots,

244
00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.090
you have these half steps.

245
00:14:56.090 --> 00:15:00.869
I can't, how am I supposed to know the
difference, distance between A and B on,

246
00:15:00.869 --> 00:15:03.960
on the open keyboard here is
only a half step, and but

247
00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.990
the difference between C and
D is a whole step.

248
00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:08.350
It's an anomaly.

249
00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:12.270
So some clever figure, his name was Guido
Avaretto, comes along and says, well,

250
00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:15.310
let's isolate this just one half step.

251
00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:19.580
And we'll go do, or, ut, re, mi,
fa, so, la, and that was it.

252
00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:23.220
He had a six six note in effect scale.

253
00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:24.220
And those two competed.

254
00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:30.034
For about 500 years until
the 17th century when the A,

255
00:15:30.034 --> 00:15:32.889
B, C, D, E, F, began to win out, but

256
00:15:32.889 --> 00:15:38.008
there was still a vestige in some
educational systems of that root, or

257
00:15:38.008 --> 00:15:44.860
do, ra, me, fa, so, la and eventually
that was filled out to ti and do again.

258
00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:48.070
So it really doesn't matter what
system that you, that you use.

259
00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:51.512
That each is equally effective.

260
00:15:51.512 --> 00:15:56.035
It's just that we have had, as a, and
again, another anomaly in western music,

261
00:15:56.035 --> 00:15:59.196
two systems that's been going on for
1,000 years.

262
00:15:59.196 --> 00:16:01.699
>> Mm-hm.
Okay.

263
00:16:01.699 --> 00:16:03.300
Do you have anything to add, James?

264
00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:08.238
>> Well, I mean, The question does
relate to playing the violin.

265
00:16:08.238 --> 00:16:08.989
>> Yeah.

266
00:16:08.989 --> 00:16:14.020
>> And
I'm trying to think here about useful ways

267
00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:18.800
to kind of,
wed those two kind of, systems.

268
00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:26.440
I mean, I guess, part of the problem I
guess, entails whether you're also trying

269
00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:32.296
to deal with reading music
on the printed page.

270
00:16:32.296 --> 00:16:37.540
Because when, when we are talking
about playing music from the score

271
00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:41.690
at that point we are somewhat
dealing with fixed pitches

272
00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:45.800
as they correlate to spots on the violin,
right.

273
00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:49.820
So you could think in terms of do re mi.

274
00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:54.080
But as far as the violin is concerned,
and man,

275
00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:58.430
you now, many other instruments also do
this, there's going to be a specific point

276
00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:03.170
on a string that corresponds to
a specific note on the page.

277
00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:07.739
And so, I guess my recommendations would
be that, if you can find a way for

278
00:17:07.739 --> 00:17:12.531
the two of you to, to kind of find the
common ground to have you're individual

279
00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:17.872
knowledge set, skill sets to somehow also
linked to what you're seeing on the page.

280
00:17:17.872 --> 00:17:22.400
That can probably help translate
that to the violin, but baring that,

281
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:26.713
you may have to find a violin teacher
who is who kind of specializes,

282
00:17:26.713 --> 00:17:29.501
who specializes in this
kind of instruction.

283
00:17:29.501 --> 00:17:30.374
So.
>> Okay.

284
00:17:30.374 --> 00:17:30.931
Well, thank you.

285
00:17:30.931 --> 00:17:31.675
>> Good luck.

286
00:17:31.675 --> 00:17:33.637
>> [LAUGH] Hope that was helpful.

287
00:17:33.637 --> 00:17:34.460
>> Don't fight over it.

288
00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:35.981
[LAUGH].

289
00:17:35.981 --> 00:17:36.853
>> Okay.

290
00:17:36.853 --> 00:17:38.610
So our next question okay.

291
00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:43.390
This is, I'm just going to give
you a little bit of context to

292
00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:45.460
why this person is asking this question.

293
00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:48.907
But he says, in the beginning of the
course, Professor Wright told us that we

294
00:17:48.907 --> 00:17:51.571
would talk more about the emotions
that music can provoke.

295
00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:55.889
I, myself, am a very sensitive person,
regarding music.

296
00:17:55.889 --> 00:17:58.284
So I was really looking
forward to this one.

297
00:17:58.284 --> 00:18:01.863
I really would like to learn,
about what happens in the brain,

298
00:18:01.863 --> 00:18:03.425
while listening to music.

299
00:18:03.425 --> 00:18:06.885
What makes the music touch the soul and
what doesn't?

300
00:18:06.885 --> 00:18:10.790
Has any scientific research
been done about this theme?

301
00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:16.500
And I'm sure someone in recent history,
has asked the same scientific question

302
00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:21.270
before, but this person is hoping
you can address it in office hours.

303
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:22.950
>> Well it's a very interesting question.

304
00:18:24.005 --> 00:18:28.625
And up until oh, I would guess,
maybe 20 years ago

305
00:18:28.625 --> 00:18:32.455
there wasn't too much that one could
do with this, this type of question.

306
00:18:32.455 --> 00:18:36.090
Said, oh, that's a heartfelt expression or
you, you've touched my heartstrings.

307
00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:36.697
>> Mm-hm.
>> Well, of course.

308
00:18:36.697 --> 00:18:38.332
Has nothing to do with
the heart whatsoever.

309
00:18:38.332 --> 00:18:42.957
[LAUGH] It has everything to do with
your brain, and your cortex, and

310
00:18:42.957 --> 00:18:46.227
the various associative linkages
that you make in the brain, and

311
00:18:46.227 --> 00:18:48.147
particularly your limbic system.

312
00:18:48.147 --> 00:18:52.640
Which is a, a part of the,
of the brain that

313
00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:57.700
is particularly powerful when things
such as emotions and feeling and

314
00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:03.530
memory begin to fire off and
begin to get in- integrated.

315
00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:07.060
Creativity is, is,
is something that transpires, and

316
00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:12.300
is generated into some measure in another
part of the brain, in, in the what?

317
00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.920
Dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex I think the-.

318
00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.526
>> Okay.
>> Is the specific term for that.

319
00:19:17.526 --> 00:19:20.817
But if you're interested in this topic,
what I recommend.

320
00:19:20.817 --> 00:19:24.047
And actually I went online and, and
posted an answer to this already.

321
00:19:24.047 --> 00:19:24.857
>> Oh, okay.

322
00:19:24.857 --> 00:19:26.784
>> Because I needed to give
specific information here.

323
00:19:26.784 --> 00:19:32.004
I peaked ahead to see what
the questions might be there is a good,

324
00:19:32.004 --> 00:19:36.080
very good article by Ann Blood,
and Robert Zatori.

325
00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:37.000
She teaches at Harvard.

326
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.510
He teaches at the University of Maguil.

327
00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:43.830
And it's published in
a national Academy of Science.

328
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:46.050
This proceedings of
the National Academy of Science 2001,

329
00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:49.270
I think,
where they take you all through this.

330
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:52.150
It takes a fair degree of experience

331
00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:54.760
understanding all the terms
of the parts of the brain.

332
00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.535
And, what these various symbols mean,
and positions within the brain.

333
00:19:57.535 --> 00:20:01.333
But, the upshot of it is,
that they, they track blood flow.

334
00:20:01.333 --> 00:20:04.853
>> Hm.
>> As we experience music now with neuro

335
00:20:04.853 --> 00:20:10.780
imaging, PET scans FMRIs,
that sort of thing, even EEGs.

336
00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:13.160
It's possible to see
what the brain is doing.

337
00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:17.290
And to watch the brain fire off
as we experience these emotion,

338
00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:23.090
emotions, and watch blood flow change
in particular parts of these organs.

339
00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:26.920
As we do so and that's,
that's fascinating, fascinating to see.

340
00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:29.630
Oddly enough, now for
the first time in human history in about

341
00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:34.806
the last 20 years with, with neural
imaging, is it possible to do that.

342
00:20:34.806 --> 00:20:39.143
That's a kind of an intellectual
explanation for all of this.

343
00:20:39.143 --> 00:20:44.735
It's not very [LAUGH] ironically, it's not
very satisfying emotionally it's taking it

344
00:20:44.735 --> 00:20:49.577
out of out of the realm realm of feeling
and passion, and into the maybe part of

345
00:20:49.577 --> 00:20:54.958
the analytical part of the brain, we're
going back to the frontal cortex now.

346
00:20:54.958 --> 00:20:59.200
With with the issue of
thinking about the brain.

347
00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.770
So we have thinking, we have feeling.

348
00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:05.080
And feeling may be again,
tied up with the, the limbic system.

349
00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:10.940
But we thought a and and I believe that,

350
00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:13.950
that question even more further
with this question since every time

351
00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:16.810
his wife listened to a particular
piece she would start to cry.

352
00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:20.110
In interesting, interesting so
again we're talking about this and

353
00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:23.030
the reason we had this
particular music teamed up here,

354
00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:25.295
is that we've chosen
a piece that we both like.

355
00:21:25.295 --> 00:21:26.410
>> Mm-hm.

356
00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:27.880
>> I like it for reasons of memory and

357
00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:32.766
I've always thought that memory and
emotions are, are deeply.

358
00:21:32.766 --> 00:21:37.301
In twine because this takes me back
to practicing with my two children.

359
00:21:37.301 --> 00:21:41.195
Not two children, I have four children but
the [LAUGH] the last two.

360
00:21:41.195 --> 00:21:43.140
[LAUGH] One was a violinist,
one was a cellist.

361
00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:45.320
So I worked through this piece with,
with both of them.

362
00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:47.270
It was originally written for a violin.

363
00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:48.890
James, do you want to say a word.

364
00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:51.812
This is a piece by Massenet,
that we both like very much.

365
00:21:51.812 --> 00:21:52.312
>> Right, sure.

366
00:21:52.312 --> 00:21:53.325
>> Do you want to say a word about it?

367
00:21:53.325 --> 00:21:57.200
>> It's, yeah, it is a piece by
the French composer Jules Massenet.

368
00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:59.540
It, it is it's called the Meditation.

369
00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:02.730
It's from one of his operas called Thai's.

370
00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:08.160
It's I don't think
there's much else to say.

371
00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.568
>> Well some of the cool,
some of the cool, why is it,

372
00:22:10.568 --> 00:22:11.983
why is it a really cool piece?

373
00:22:11.983 --> 00:22:15.071
Well we get these really
lush harmonic movements.

374
00:22:15.071 --> 00:22:24.464
[MUSIC]

375
00:22:24.464 --> 00:22:27.833
So really sort of great chords and then.

376
00:22:27.833 --> 00:22:33.710
I, these moments in which music is up on
a high point, and we've reached the peak.

377
00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:35.220
And now we're coming off it.

378
00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:36.199
We begin to, to relax.

379
00:22:36.199 --> 00:22:41.179
And it's oftentimes having to
do with the very powerful, and

380
00:22:41.179 --> 00:22:45.986
secure harmonic patterns
underneath as the line unfolds-

381
00:22:45.986 --> 00:22:48.365
[MUSIC]

382
00:22:48.365 --> 00:22:53.667
In a sequence, could be a rhythmic
sequence, a melodic sequence it depends.

383
00:22:53.667 --> 00:22:57.543
We get the harmony plus kind of a
relaxation of the emotions at that point,

384
00:22:57.543 --> 00:22:59.680
maybe James you want to play off of that.

385
00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:00.532
[MUSIC]

386
00:23:00.532 --> 00:23:01.275
>> Sure.

387
00:23:01.275 --> 00:23:04.922
>> That, that particular spot, are you,
you, you know, just play your line there.

388
00:23:04.922 --> 00:23:09.070
>> Well yeah.
[CROSSTALK] We'll, we'll get to it but I,

389
00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:13.434
I think I agree that part of
the effect of the piece comes

390
00:23:13.434 --> 00:23:18.173
from the way that the phrase works,
or the phrasings work.

391
00:23:18.173 --> 00:23:21.772
Which is that there's, for,
for the first part it,

392
00:23:21.772 --> 00:23:26.700
there's kind of a constant Kind of climb,
but it doesn't climb very quickly.

393
00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.522
Kind of climbs a little bit, back down.

394
00:23:28.522 --> 00:23:29.346
>> Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.

395
00:23:29.346 --> 00:23:30.920
Mm-hm.
>> Climb a little more, back down.

396
00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:35.305
And then finally we get to
kind of the climactic-.

397
00:23:35.305 --> 00:23:37.242
>> Mm-hm.
>> Part of the phrase where it really hits

398
00:23:37.242 --> 00:23:41.280
the highest note, and then as Craig was
saying, now then we immediately begin

399
00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:45.494
another sequence, but it's a descending
sequence where you, it's going down, and

400
00:23:45.494 --> 00:23:47.881
down a little more, and
then down a little more.

401
00:23:47.881 --> 00:23:54.035
So you cn kind of feel the kind of ebb and
flow of intensity.

402
00:23:54.035 --> 00:23:55.040
>> Mm-hm.

403
00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:55.763
>> Intensity.
And so

404
00:23:55.763 --> 00:24:00.343
I think that that's what part of what
makes this an effective piece of music.

405
00:24:00.343 --> 00:24:08.116
But I think both Craig and
I being on the artistic side of the-.

406
00:24:08.116 --> 00:24:10.287
Scholarly enterprise, I think we.

407
00:24:10.287 --> 00:24:11.955
>> We're in the right side of the.

408
00:24:11.955 --> 00:24:16.665
>> Yeah, we, we I think some of
this stuff is, can be describing,

409
00:24:16.665 --> 00:24:22.058
can be explained, but so much of it is
also just feel, na, natural in a sense.

410
00:24:22.058 --> 00:24:24.813
>> Okay.
>> So where are we going to start?

411
00:24:24.813 --> 00:24:27.532
We can, we probably don't have time for
the whole piece you,

412
00:24:27.532 --> 00:24:28.748
you want to just take it or-

413
00:24:28.748 --> 00:24:30.939
[MUSIC]
Should we climb up to that?

414
00:24:30.939 --> 00:24:31.879
You want-

415
00:24:31.879 --> 00:24:34.074
[MUSIC]

416
00:24:34.074 --> 00:24:35.292
>> [MUSIC]

417
00:24:35.292 --> 00:24:36.976
>> You want to

418
00:24:36.976 --> 00:24:37.800
[MUSIC]

419
00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.920
You want to take it up 40, my 40.

420
00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:41.060
>> Yeah is that right there?

421
00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:42.270
>> Yeah it's an F sharp.

422
00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:43.300
>> Sure, sure, let's do that.

423
00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:46.640
>> So this is coming from us
out to you and your enigma.

424
00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:47.150
>> All right [LAUGH].

425
00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:48.599
>> Whoever asked that question.

426
00:24:48.599 --> 00:24:49.590
>> All right, here we go.

427
00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:50.710
>> Amygdala, Amygdala.

428
00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:51.326
Here we go.

429
00:24:51.326 --> 00:24:52.583
>> Where should we go to?

430
00:24:52.583 --> 00:24:53.338
Sorry.

431
00:24:53.338 --> 00:24:54.091
>> And then I'll take it all
the way to the end, maybe.

432
00:24:54.091 --> 00:24:54.696
>> Oh, okay.

433
00:24:54.696 --> 00:24:55.519
Sure.
Okay.

434
00:24:55.519 --> 00:24:56.251
>> We'll see.

435
00:24:56.251 --> 00:25:06.251
[MUSIC]

436
00:26:59.477 --> 00:27:00.325
Beautiful.

437
00:27:00.325 --> 00:27:02.340
>> Yeah, that was fun.

438
00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:02.885
Oh.
>> He's good.

439
00:27:02.885 --> 00:27:05.520
[LAUGH]
>> You both are good.

440
00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:06.663
>> He should cover me more often.

441
00:27:06.663 --> 00:27:08.200
[LAUGH].
>> You need to practice more.

442
00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.035
That's how I get good.

443
00:27:09.035 --> 00:27:11.440
[LAUGH]
>> Well that was, that was great.

444
00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.907
>> He should cover me more often.

445
00:27:12.907 --> 00:27:15.110
[LAUGH].

446
00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:15.620
>> All right.

447
00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:18.370
So, I guess we should move
to the next question.

448
00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:22.740
>> Sure.
>> And this question is asking can you

449
00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:26.890
explain the difference between the most
basic musical terms you use throughout

450
00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:32.460
the course, tune, theme, melody,
motif, are they synonyms, or?

451
00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.335
>> That's good, that's a good question.

452
00:27:35.335 --> 00:27:36.076
>> Mm-hm.

453
00:27:36.076 --> 00:27:39.510
>> I think sometimes we
tend to use those terms.

454
00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:43.030
Somewhat loosely, and
somewhat interchangeably,

455
00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:45.610
but some of them are also separate.

456
00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:49.030
So let's start with tune,
tune is a very informal term.

457
00:27:51.108 --> 00:27:57.200
We will often use that to loosely describe
any sort of, recognizable melody.

458
00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.510
[MUSIC]
Exactly.

459
00:27:58.510 --> 00:27:59.450
Melody I think is,

460
00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:04.190
is a mor, more conformal at least
a little bit more formal term.

461
00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:08.200
Which really does tend to be used for

462
00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:10.940
a musical idea that's
somewhat self enclosed.

463
00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:12.570
>> Okay.
>> So, for instance,

464
00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:16.792
if I were to hum something like bah,
dah, dah, dah, dah.

465
00:28:16.792 --> 00:28:17.337
Like that.

466
00:28:17.337 --> 00:28:18.917
>> Mm-hm.
>> We probably wouldn't call

467
00:28:18.917 --> 00:28:19.577
that a melody.

468
00:28:19.577 --> 00:28:23.033
I mean, it is self enclosed in that it's,
you know, it's right there, bah, dah,

469
00:28:23.033 --> 00:28:24.017
dah, dah, dah.

470
00:28:24.017 --> 00:28:27.998
But usually we tend to give melody
a little bit more of an expansive kind of

471
00:28:27.998 --> 00:28:28.796
definition.

472
00:28:28.796 --> 00:28:31.079
[MUSIC]

473
00:28:31.079 --> 00:28:31.878
Yeah, exactly.
>> Okay.

474
00:28:31.878 --> 00:28:34.500
>> Maybe one way of looking at it would be

475
00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:39.070
a melody could be somewhat
akin to like a sentence.

476
00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:39.640
>> Okay.

477
00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.140
>> Like you'll kind of go,

478
00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:44.780
a complete idea it doesn't necessarily
always have to map onto that.

479
00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:46.605
It doesn't necessarily always
have a very strict end.

480
00:28:46.605 --> 00:28:48.191
>> Mm-hm.
>> But usually has this kind of

481
00:28:48.191 --> 00:28:49.679
self contained quality to it.

482
00:28:49.679 --> 00:28:50.482
>> Okay.

483
00:28:50.482 --> 00:28:54.150
>> And a theme is usually somewhat
of a similar type of term.

484
00:28:55.730 --> 00:29:01.930
If you happen to watch the other video
that I made about new world symphony,

485
00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:06.406
the first movement, you'll see that
there's some discussion about theme,

486
00:29:06.406 --> 00:29:08.960
and some of the qualities
that it might have, and

487
00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:12.630
how it's not necessarily always again
it's a totally encapsulated idea.

488
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:17.020
Sometimes it can start like a theme in,
you know, a,

489
00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:20.205
a theme can start and
it might kind of trail off and keep going.

490
00:29:20.205 --> 00:29:21.610
>> Mm-hm.
>> But the idea is that,

491
00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:26.290
that it's still a kind of a parsable idea.

492
00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:26.912
>> Okay.

493
00:29:26.912 --> 00:29:30.529
>> And but on the other had, a,
a motif is a very different thing

494
00:29:30.529 --> 00:29:31.143
[MUSIC]

495
00:29:31.143 --> 00:29:35.783
Exactly, a motif is usually,
a shorter idea, and,

496
00:29:35.783 --> 00:29:40.423
and it is not necessarily
meant to convey the same

497
00:29:40.423 --> 00:29:45.660
kind of musical effect that a theme or
a melody might do.

498
00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:48.910
Instead, it's more of a kind of a,
a piece, or building block.

499
00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:50.540
>> Okay.
>> And it's often used,

500
00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:56.290
kind of more frequently,
and sometimes used as a,

501
00:29:56.290 --> 00:30:00.750
again, kind of as a building block,
a Lego for instance, for, for a piece.

502
00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:04.275
So you might have in a piece
that has a melody and

503
00:30:04.275 --> 00:30:09.228
then has other things, might also have
mot, motif run, running through it.

504
00:30:09.228 --> 00:30:12.931
So the Beethoven five is a great one,
idea, the pa, pa, paa.

505
00:30:12.931 --> 00:30:16.106
>> Mm-hm.
>> And, and that as a rhythmic motif, pa,

506
00:30:16.106 --> 00:30:16.820
pa, pa.

507
00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:18.700
Persistent, not only in
that first movement, but

508
00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:19.900
across the different movements.

509
00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:25.650
That's actually one of the ways composers
can give some sense of relationship

510
00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:30.395
across movements within an entire work,
would be it a symphony or a concerto.

511
00:30:30.395 --> 00:30:30.930
>> Mm-hm.

512
00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:34.550
>> So that's a great question and
in this case we can kind of put theme and

513
00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:36.380
melody maybe together.

514
00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:37.865
And then in a separate category is motif.

515
00:30:37.865 --> 00:30:38.498
>> Okay.

516
00:30:38.498 --> 00:30:41.622
>> Tune is kind of on its
own as an informal term,

517
00:30:41.622 --> 00:30:46.821
although it's probably more close to
theme and melody than it is to motif.

518
00:30:46.821 --> 00:30:48.460
>> Okay, cool.

519
00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:51.151
Hm, I think that's
a very good explanation.

520
00:30:51.151 --> 00:30:53.102
An apology, I mispronounced motif.

521
00:30:53.102 --> 00:30:55.098
>> We should craft a quiz
question along those lines.

522
00:30:55.098 --> 00:30:55.796
>> Yeah.

523
00:30:55.796 --> 00:30:57.323
>> Well the motif.

524
00:30:57.323 --> 00:30:59.437
>> [LAUGH].

525
00:30:59.437 --> 00:31:02.420
[LAUGH] So our next question.

526
00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:06.610
Oh, this is a good one.

527
00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:11.616
So if we're to take away one,
maybe two or three, things,

528
00:31:11.616 --> 00:31:17.945
most important things from this course,
what would, what would they be?

529
00:31:17.945 --> 00:31:18.942
What would that be?

530
00:31:18.942 --> 00:31:20.046
>> Oh, wow.

531
00:31:20.046 --> 00:31:21.320
>> [LAUGH].

532
00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:22.200
>> That is a good question.

533
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:25.760
Should I take this one Greg?

534
00:31:27.226 --> 00:31:29.612
>> We have taped, we have three?

535
00:31:29.612 --> 00:31:30.551
>> Between one and three.

536
00:31:30.551 --> 00:31:32.189
>> Yes.
>> What, one and three.

537
00:31:32.189 --> 00:31:34.195
Well I'll do.
>> This person really wants three.

538
00:31:34.195 --> 00:31:35.380
[LAUGH]
>> Wants three.

539
00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:37.460
No more, no less.

540
00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:42.810
I could do, let me do, part a and part b.

541
00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:47.218
One thing well lots of
things you could say.

542
00:31:47.218 --> 00:31:52.196
I hope that they had learned
from this experience that music

543
00:31:52.196 --> 00:31:57.488
doesn't exist in a closed room or
in a box or in isolation.

544
00:31:57.488 --> 00:32:00.555
And what we try to do in this
course is get it out there and

545
00:32:00.555 --> 00:32:04.361
show people that it relates to
literature it relates to poetry, and

546
00:32:04.361 --> 00:32:08.360
particularly the visual arts and
that you can understand music.

547
00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:11.068
Sometimes better if you
understand the visual arts.

548
00:32:11.068 --> 00:32:12.688
When I go to an art gallery,

549
00:32:12.688 --> 00:32:16.920
I'm spending spend a lot of my time
thinking about musical analogies.

550
00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:20.110
And when I go to a concert sometimes
I'm thinking about art that might be

551
00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:22.650
playing out some thing that I've
seen recently in an art gallery.

552
00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:26.399
So get out there, enjoy things and
think about your music,

553
00:32:26.399 --> 00:32:30.786
think of it in connection with other
types of intellectual pursuits.

554
00:32:30.786 --> 00:32:31.331
>> Okay.

555
00:32:31.331 --> 00:32:32.357
>> Mm.

556
00:32:32.357 --> 00:32:33.644
>> Very well said.

557
00:32:33.644 --> 00:32:39.092
>> I think I I might build off of that and
say that one thing that I would

558
00:32:39.092 --> 00:32:45.319
hope that we can all take away from this
course or, you know, any study of music,

559
00:32:45.319 --> 00:32:50.509
is that one, there is always a larger
context not just other arts,

560
00:32:50.509 --> 00:32:55.678
but also history the history of ideas,
history of culture.

561
00:32:55.678 --> 00:33:01.297
And uh,many of those things get built
in to the music either directly or

562
00:33:01.297 --> 00:33:05.887
indirectly depending on what
the composer is up to and

563
00:33:05.887 --> 00:33:09.073
also depending on how we as listeners and

564
00:33:09.073 --> 00:33:13.124
receivers our,
our position in our own time.

565
00:33:13.124 --> 00:33:13.897
>> Mm-hm.

566
00:33:13.897 --> 00:33:16.968
>> I mean,
we can learn a lot about the music and

567
00:33:16.968 --> 00:33:19.624
we can learn a lot about its context but

568
00:33:19.624 --> 00:33:25.550
to some degree some of that legwork also
comes from us and what we bring to it.

569
00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:29.492
Think is an interesting or hopefully
useful take away from this course would

570
00:33:29.492 --> 00:33:32.201
be the idea that this music and
a lot of music really,

571
00:33:32.201 --> 00:33:35.980
not just not just the music we were
able to talk about in this course.

572
00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:41.226
But but so much music out there is so
rewarding when you revisit it and

573
00:33:41.226 --> 00:33:46.720
when you dedicate a lot of time and
energy to getting to know it.

574
00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:51.250
So much of what we've done in this course
obviously takes place within a video

575
00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:56.220
lecture but it can be done on your own and

576
00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:58.632
repeatedly with all of
the music you listen to.

577
00:33:58.632 --> 00:34:04.884
Music can, can be enjoyed on an emotional
level, without any kind of thought or

578
00:34:04.884 --> 00:34:09.754
whatnot, you can kind of just
enjoy as it passes through you.

579
00:34:09.754 --> 00:34:10.461
>> Mm-hm.

580
00:34:10.461 --> 00:34:14.979
>> But it can also be extremely rewarding
if you come back to it again and again,

581
00:34:14.979 --> 00:34:16.517
with different mindsets.

582
00:34:16.517 --> 00:34:21.150
You come back with the idea that you to
parse it and you want to see what's it's

583
00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:25.922
up to some degree or, or come back to it
again and try to figure out what it's

584
00:34:25.922 --> 00:34:30.083
form is or come back to it again and
see how much you can remember of it.

585
00:34:30.083 --> 00:34:33.929
Or how much you might try to hear
from different lines rather than just

586
00:34:33.929 --> 00:34:35.140
the melodic line.

587
00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:38.200
So I think that it, one of the things
that I, at least, find very rewarding,

588
00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:40.150
is that so much of this music.

589
00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:45.010
And again, and other repertoires
out there are so fulfilling and

590
00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:48.806
are so
rewarding with repeated interaction.

591
00:34:48.806 --> 00:34:49.435
>> Okay.

592
00:34:49.435 --> 00:34:52.250
Great, wonderful.

593
00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:59.420
Now do you want to add one more or
just leave at that?

594
00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:00.650
>> One addendum to that.

595
00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:04.835
Within the last 24 hours, one,
i was driving away from a gymnasium.

596
00:35:04.835 --> 00:35:05.354
>> Mm.
>> If you look at me,

597
00:35:05.354 --> 00:35:06.814
you wouldn't believe I'd
actually go to a gymnasium.

598
00:35:06.814 --> 00:35:07.555
[LAUGH].
But I,

599
00:35:07.555 --> 00:35:08.857
I've been known to go to a gymnasium.

600
00:35:08.857 --> 00:35:10.594
And I was listening to the radio, and

601
00:35:10.594 --> 00:35:13.069
there was this beautiful
piece by Otorina Raspini.

602
00:35:13.069 --> 00:35:15.445
>> Mm.
>> And wow, I'd never heard that before,

603
00:35:15.445 --> 00:35:16.970
it was called Autumnal Poem.

604
00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:18.822
I've never heard the piece but, so

605
00:35:18.822 --> 00:35:22.197
here's this vast repertoire
of music that's out there.

606
00:35:22.197 --> 00:35:25.727
And then to, to reinforce, reiterate what,

607
00:35:25.727 --> 00:35:31.040
what James was saying, then earlier
about oh, oh, about three, four,

608
00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:35.630
three hours ago, I was there at my desk
and I was listening to a piece of music,

609
00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:39.090
I wanted to find a piece of music from
the Middle Ages, needn't say why.

610
00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:42.888
I started listening to this piece of music
and I hadn't heard it in a long time.

611
00:35:42.888 --> 00:35:46.953
Now, I wasn't there for
the premier because, old as I may be,

612
00:35:46.953 --> 00:35:48.733
I'm not 600 years old.

613
00:35:48.733 --> 00:35:49.301
[LAUGH].

614
00:35:49.301 --> 00:35:53.302
So, this was from about 1420, 1420.

615
00:35:53.302 --> 00:35:55.902
And it was stunningly beautiful.

616
00:35:55.902 --> 00:35:59.033
Now I'd heard this piece before,
and what this says to me is,

617
00:35:59.033 --> 00:36:01.093
is the change is absolutely right here.

618
00:36:01.093 --> 00:36:05.694
One of the great beauties of music and
art, generally, is we never get tired of

619
00:36:05.694 --> 00:36:10.152
it, if you put it aside, you can come
back to it, and it seems just as fresh,

620
00:36:10.152 --> 00:36:14.250
just as fresh now, as it did
the first time you encountered it.

621
00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:16.344
Maybe it's like, like love, who knows?

622
00:36:16.344 --> 00:36:17.913
>> Mm.
>> [LAUGH] But, but

623
00:36:17.913 --> 00:36:20.373
there is an element to that.

624
00:36:20.373 --> 00:36:22.707
The piece was the requiem
mass by Johannes Ochachum.

625
00:36:22.707 --> 00:36:24.413
It's beautiful, go listen to it.

626
00:36:24.413 --> 00:36:25.133
All right.

627
00:36:25.133 --> 00:36:26.492
Okay.

628
00:36:26.492 --> 00:36:31.795
Now, we have our last question for
our last office hour.

629
00:36:31.795 --> 00:36:32.874
Very sad.

630
00:36:32.874 --> 00:36:35.592
When will this course be repeated?

631
00:36:35.592 --> 00:36:37.321
[LAUGH].

632
00:36:37.321 --> 00:36:39.215
>> When will this course be repeated?

633
00:36:39.215 --> 00:36:40.530
>> Yes.
>> That's an interesting question,

634
00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:41.366
I don't think we're sure.

635
00:36:41.366 --> 00:36:46.736
We were talking with our
friends here our broadcast

636
00:36:46.736 --> 00:36:54.160
team here before we were coming in and
it may repe, be repeated as early as.

637
00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:57.140
Six to eight weeks from
now it may be placed

638
00:36:58.150 --> 00:37:02.910
on what Coursera is calling the on,
on-demand platform.

639
00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:06.170
We would have to know.

640
00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:09.935
There's things that we probably some
things we could do a little bit better.

641
00:37:09.935 --> 00:37:12.590
We, we all can always do better,
so we might try to improve things.

642
00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:17.900
We'll take it down for two months and then
put it back up either in a discrete time

643
00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:22.950
format, or put it up again OnDemand so
that anybody, anywhere around the world,

644
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:28.620
at any time can come and
e,e,enjoy and engage this.

645
00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:32.530
So, the, the wonderful thing about this
experiment with our broadcast team and

646
00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:36.840
all has been that we don't always
know exactly what we're doing or

647
00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:37.980
where we're going with this.

648
00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:39.700
And that's part of the excitement and
part of,

649
00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:42.450
part of the fun,
we'll see how it plays out.

650
00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:44.130
The one thing we learned is,

651
00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:48.350
judging from these numbers that Melissa
articulated at the beginning of our

652
00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:53.200
gathering here, judging from these numbers
this is a powerful, powerful medium.

653
00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:57.420
I had no idea that this
could be what it is.

654
00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:00.820
People all around the world,
thousands of them,

655
00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:04.170
engaging in an artistic or
intellectual project.

656
00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:09.150
And I have learned an enormous amount
from reading what our learners are,

657
00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:10.180
are sending me.

658
00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:14.980
They're out there, again,
putting together learning groups

659
00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:19.080
gathering discussion forums where
they're all learning together, and

660
00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:25.530
they're solving everyone else's problems,
or answering everyone else's questions.

661
00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:28.260
That, I think, you asked,
what's the big takeaway, here?

662
00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:29.745
Give us one of three takeaways.

663
00:38:29.745 --> 00:38:30.350
>> Mm-hm.

664
00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:35.830
>> The the really big take away maybe the
elephant in the room here is that as a,

665
00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:42.710
as a program, as an initiative this is
where in my opinion where the future lies.

666
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:44.322
>> Yeah, for sure.

667
00:38:44.322 --> 00:38:49.014
All right well I think I can speak for
everyone here at the broadcast center and

668
00:38:49.014 --> 00:38:52.618
in the office of digital dissemination
that we had a lot of fun,

669
00:38:52.618 --> 00:38:54.465
putting this course together.

670
00:38:54.465 --> 00:38:59.174
And thank you James, and
thank you Craig for being a part of it.

671
00:38:59.174 --> 00:38:59.929
>> Thank you Melissa.

672
00:38:59.929 --> 00:39:01.369
And thank you everyone out there.

673
00:39:01.369 --> 00:39:04.968
We really enjoyed getting to
know you through Coursera.

674
00:39:04.968 --> 00:39:06.427
>> And thanks to our team.

675
00:39:06.427 --> 00:39:08.518
>> Yeah, thank you to the team for sure.

676
00:39:08.518 --> 00:39:11.536
>> All right, shall we play a s,
play a sad tune for.

677
00:39:11.536 --> 00:39:13.923
[LAUGH].

678
00:39:13.923 --> 00:39:15.814
Perfect.

679
00:39:15.814 --> 00:39:16.743
>> There's our Chopin.

[MUSIC]

681
00:39:18.276 --> 00:39:21.097
>> Isn't it his birthday or something.

682
00:39:21.097 --> 00:39:23.744
I got an announcement
about that the other day.

683
00:39:23.744 --> 00:39:25.369
>> Sorry, I don't know Chopin's birthday.

684
00:39:25.369 --> 00:39:26.042
>> No.

686
00:39:32.289 --> 00:39:33.821
We can't end in a minor key, right?
